			"body": "Britain is heading for a series of clashes with Brussels, after ministers from the 27 remaining member states agreed proposals which would require the UK to obey the EU rule-book in full for around two years after Brexit. Downing Street acknowledged there were \"differences\" between London and Brussels over the nature of the \"transition period\" following the official date of Brexit in March 2019. And horrified Brexiteers urged Theresa May to reject the \"ultimatum\" set out in the negotiating mandate detailing the deal chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier will seek in talks expected to last until March. The document, agreed in a meeting lasting just two minutes in Brussels, includes proposals for:. - A transition period of 21 months, ending on December 31 2020, rather than the \"implementation period\" of around two years favoured by Mrs May;. - The cut-off date for EU citizens to enjoy full rights in the UK to be the end of the transition in December 2020, rather than March 2019 as suggested in the agreement on phase one of the Brexit talks last month;. - Britain to be required to obey all existing EU rules and regulations - including free movement of people - during transition, as well as any new laws agreed by the 27 after the UK has been removed from decision-making bodies;. - The UK to continue to comply with EU trade policy until the end of transition, meaning it cannot implement new trade deals. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Barnier insisted the UK could not pick and choose the rules it will follow. \"During transition the UK will continue to take part in the single market, to take part in the customs union,\" he said. \"It will continue to have all the economic benefits, therefore it must also apply all the EU rules. The single market cannot be a la carte.\" Downing Street said the new guidelines were \"well aligned\" with the UK position set out by Mrs May in her speech in Florence last year, though her official spokesman added: \"There will naturally be some distance in the detail of our starting positions.\" Brexit Secretary David Davis predicted bust-ups over several aspects of the EU's stance. \"There will be an argument about the right to negotiate free trade agreements,\" he told the House of Lords EU Committee. \"There will be an argument, I'm sure, about the issue of whether or not we can object to new laws that we haven't had a say in. \"There will be discussions about issues like representation on technical committee.\" Mr Davis also suggested that final agreement on the withdrawal deal may continue as late as the end of 2018 in order to allow more time to \"iron out\" details of the future UK/EU trade relationship. But Mr Barnier gave short shrift to the idea, saying the October deadline for the deal could not change by more than a week or so because time had to be allowed for ratification. In the House of Commons, Tory eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash urged the Government to reject any agreement which requires the UK to remain a part of EU frameworks after the date of Brexit. \"Given that we're leaving the EU and therefore the customs union, the single market and the provisions relating to freedom of movement, is the Government going to reject this new EU ultimatum - including that the EU court of justice will continue to apply to the UK?\" he asked. And former minister John Redwood said Britain must be prepared to walk away without a deal. \"Many of us want new borders, fishing and agriculture policies and the reduction of taxes the EU insists on where we do not agree,\" said Mr Redwood. \"To get on with improving these we do not want a two-year so-called transitional period if that means we can't take control of our laws, borders and money.\" As Mrs May met her Brexit \"inner circle\" for a meeting in Downing Street, the chairman of the Commons Exiting the EU Committee, Hilary Benn, was scathing about ministers' failure to provide a clear vision of the post-withdrawal end-state which they are seeking. \"We are now 19 months on from the referendum and neither Parliament nor the rest of EU are any the wiser about what the Government actually wants from the Brexit negotiations,\" said Mr Benn. \"Extraordinary and unacceptable.\" Downing Street declined to comment on reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had told reporters in a private meeting that whenever she asks Mrs May what she is seeking, the Prime Minister responds: \"Make me an offer.\" Brexit legislation will go before the House of Lords on Tuesday where it is set for a rocky ride. Sir Vince Cable said he believes the Liberal Democrats can win enough support to get at least 10 amendments through, including junking the exit day from the legislation through an \"unholy alliance\".

Virgin has been awarded the new West Coast franchise and Lord Adonis said this was \"without any competition whatsoever\" and Stagecoach was being allowed to bid for further franchises \"despite walking away from the East Coast mainline\". Lord Adonis claimed the Transport Secretary's actions were \"costing the taxpayer very dearly\" after peers heard a Government statement on the contract for running the East Coast franchise ending earlier than expected. He told the Lords Mr Grayling was \"undertaking another unjustified bailout of Virgin and Stagecoach at the expense of taxpayers\". Lord Adonis said: \"The reason for these disgraceful bailouts we've been seeing from Mr Grayling is because he simply is not prepared to contemplate putting his duty above ideology and substituting for failing private companies a state company. \"He wants to make a whole set of cheap points about private good and public bad, which demean his office and are costing the taxpayer very dearly.\" Transport minister Baroness Sugg, who had repeated the Government's statement in the Lords, dismissed Lord Adonis' accusations, saying: \"I'm afraid we don't recognise the bailout accusation.\" \"Stagecoach will be held to all their contractual obligations in full,\" she added, and it would lose nearly £200 million under the change. Lady Sugg acknowledged the West Coast franchise was a \"direct award\" and no other bidder was involved. She said the privatisation process had brought benefits to rail users through investment in new trains, and highlighted customer satisfaction with services on the East Coast route. Virgin Trains issued a statement about the West Coast Mainline. it said: \"Virgin Trains customers on the West Coast will see a significant improvement in on-board WiFi later this year. \"All 56 Pendolino trains will undergo a refit which will vastly improve the on-board equipment, and allow free WiFi to be extended to all Pendolino customers. \"The £7.5 million investment is part of a new deal agreed with the Government, which will see Virgin Trains continue to run the West Coast franchise through to at least March 31 2019, with the option for up to a further one-year extension at the Department for Transport's discretion. \"The existing franchise expires on March 31 2018, and the new contract will bridge the gap between the existing franchise and the new West Coast Partnership, due to start on April 1 2019. \"Installation of the WiFi upgrade is planned to begin on the Pendolino fleet from May 2018, with the work expected to be completed by January 2019, when free WiFi will be extended to all Pendolino customers. More than 85 per cent of our customers travel on Pendolinos. In addition, the new technology is 'future-proofed' so it will work with 5G mobile phone networks as they come on stream and offer further speed improvements. \"The upgrade will also unlock the ability to offer more technology-led improvements in the future, all of which will increase customer satisfaction.\"",

Virgin Trains issued a statement about the West Coast Mainline. it said: \"Virgin Trains customers on the West Coast will see a significant improvement in on-board WiFi later this year. \"All 56 Pendolino trains will undergo a refit which will vastly improve the on-board equipment, and allow free WiFi to be extended to all Pendolino customers. \"The £7.5 million investment is part of a new deal agreed with the Government, which will see Virgin Trains continue to run the West Coast franchise through to at least March 31 2019, with the option for up to a further one-year extension at the Department for Transport's discretion. \"The existing franchise expires on March 31 2018, and the new contract will bridge the gap between the existing franchise and the new West Coast Partnership, due to start on April 1 2019. \"Installation of the WiFi upgrade is planned to begin on the Pendolino fleet from May 2018, with the work expected to be completed by January 2019, when free WiFi will be extended to all Pendolino customers. More than 85 per cent of our customers travel on Pendolinos. In addition, the new technology is 'future-proofed' so it will work with 5G mobile phone networks as they come on stream and offer further speed improvements. \"The upgrade will also unlock the ability to offer more technology-led improvements in the future, all of which will increase customer satisfaction.\"",

Engineers are scheduled to install a new piece of track overnight this weekend after a crack was discovered on the approach to Liverpool Street station last Sunday. Two platforms at the London station were forced to close and this affected a number of peak Greater Anglia services to and from the capital. The section of track is specially made to fit a curve on the approach to Liverpool Street and Network Rail said the crack was too big to repair – meaning a replacement part was required. Passengers took to social media to make their feelings known about the delays and cancellations to services. Steve Hooker, Network Rail’s head of maintenance for Anglia, said: “I understand that some passengers will have had some difficult journeys over the last few days and I’d like to apologise to those who have been affected. “We have worked as quickly as possible to build a new piece of track so that services can return to normal. I’d like to thank passengers for their patience during this time.” Jamie Burles, Greater Anglia managing director, thanked passengers who have been affected during the week. “I’d like to thank our customers for their patience this week,” he said. “We have been trying hard to make sure that all customers have been able to get to their destination by train, but we’re sorry that trains were fuller than usual and that there were some delays and cancellations. “Liverpool Street is such a busy station, it’s not possible to run all trains in the rush hour as normal when two platforms are closed. “We drafted in extra help at affected stations to help customers catch their right train to try to make things a little easier for customers.” Saturday services will run as scheduled but there may be some changes to morning services on Sunday. Passengers are asked to check before travelling via www.greateranglia.co.uk, the Greater Anglia app, @greateranglia on Twitter, or www.nationalrail.co.uk",

			"body": "Hector Bellerin doesn't fit the stereotype of your average footballer.\n \nAt 23-years-old, he's already left Barcelona's legendary La Masia academy for the chance of a pathway through to first team football at Arsenal, purchased an eco-friendly Tesla car and is heavily into his fashion.\n \nIt seems to have so far worked for the Spaniard - despite being snubbed for the World Cup in Russia this summer, Bellerin has be labelled as five of the 'untouchables' by new boss Unai Emery, alongside Alexandre Lacazette, Granit Xhaka, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the Arsenal squad.\n \nHe's also one of the highest regarded full backs in the Premier League, and it all stems back to a decision as a 16-year-old to leave the familiar surroundings of La Masia and sign for Arsenal.\n \nSokratis, Torreira, Ramsey - Predicted Arsenal starting XI for Manchester City opener\n \nSome might call it tough, but as Bellerin himself explains, he likes challenges.\n \nSpeaking to Wealthsimple’s Money Diaries, he said: &quot;When footballers in Europe turn 16, they can sign working contracts, which means they can go abroad. I was playing with FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, and when I turned 16, I thought I would stay with Barca.\n \n&quot;But I wasn't feeling like they were showing me on paper what they were saying — let’s put it that way. I'm not talking just financially, but also in terms of my path into the first team.\n \n \n \n \n&quot;Halfway through that year, I got the call that Arsenal were interested in me. So, I went to London, saw the facilities, met with the boss, and they made me an offer.\n \n&quot;Everything looked so great, and my path into the first team was clear — obviously as long as I worked hard and I was reaching my targets. I like challenges and adventures.\n \n&quot;Even though people might have thought I was putting myself in a tough position by leaving my country and my family, it was actually quite easy, and exciting.\n \n \n \n \nMoney is a big subject for top flight footballers - everyone has an opinion on the amount stars are paid for plying their trade in the Premier League.\n \nBut for Bellerin, his upbringing as young boy in Spain with his grandmother has had an effect on how he views the vast sums he gets paid as a footballer and has taught him the value of the money that comes into his bank account every month.\n \nThere's no wonder why the 23-year-old is so into fashion, it's been ingrained him from an early age when his grandmother would pay him &pound;2 to clean her factory.\n \n'A big few weeks' -Jack Wilshere provides update on his future after leaving Arsenal\n \n&quot;I don’t actually know the most expensive thing I’ve ever bought., he added, &quot;it would probably be a jacket, because I don't really spend that much on any other things. Loads of players love cars. Loads of players love the stock markets.\n \n&quot;For me, it's fashion. My mom and grandma have made clothes their whole life.\n \n&quot;My grandma had her own factory. When there was no kids to play football with in my local park, I would go to my grandma's factory. She used to give me &pound;2 if I cleaned all the threads and scraps off the floor. I even learned how to sew.&quot;\n \n \n \n \nFootball is a short career and for some, it comes to an end all too soon.\n \nDespite the money and the glamour, once a player's career comes to an end there's a big wide world out there that very little have explored in terms of career avenues, with most only knowing football.\n \nIt's a concern - some players leave it late to start planning for life after football, but Bellerin isn't like those stars, showing remarkable maturity for someone as young as 23.\n \nEngland &amp; Man City star Raheem Sterling reveals why he chose to join QPR over Arsenal\n \nInstead, his ambition is to make sure he gets to a stage in his career where he can play football without having to think about the money that comes with it, and the road to that has started already as Bellerin has began planning for his life in the future.\n \n&quot;What I'm making sure is that I have something for life after. My goal is to get to a point where I can play football without having to think about how much I'm getting paid — a point in which the finance is not in my head anymore.\n \n&quot;Some players, when they get to age 27 or 28, all of a sudden they get this thought in their head like, &quot;I don't know if I have that much time anymore, so I'm gonna have to start investing.”\n \n \n \n \n&quot;And sometimes they put so much risk into it that they end up losing money. I thought, instead of waiting so long, why don't I just start taking care and managing my money and getting ready for the future now?\n \n&quot;It might be 15 to 20 years away, but the sooner you do it, the more ready you are when it happens.&quot;\n \nTo read the full interview with Bellerin, visit: Wealthsimple’s Money Diaries\n \nHow Arsenal boss Unai Emery can help Mesut Ozil to realise his true potential this season\n \nKeep up to date with the latest news, features and exclusives from football.london via the free football.london app for iPhone and Android.\n \nAvailable to download from the App Store and Google Play.",

			"body": "While both Granit Xhaka's and Xherdan Shaqiri's celebrations may have seemed harmless at first glance - a passionate response in a famous Swiss World Cup victory - the real meaning lies deeper.\n \nSwitzerland's squad has a diverse make-up with a number of players holding dual nationality or having roots elsewhere.\n \nShaqiri for example wore boots donning both the Swiss and Kosovan flag. As he noted: &quot;I was born in Kosovo, but I grew up in Switzerland. I live both mentalities, it's not a big difference.&quot;\n \nHowever, such connotations are not quite as simple as that when you consider that Kosovo is not recognised as independent from Serbia by the nation, and the appearance of such a flag could be considered provocative.\n \nBoth Shaqiri - who speaks Albanian - and Xhaka formed their hands into what is generally considered to be an eagle - the symbol of Albanian flag.\n \n \nSerbia 1-2 Switzerland player ratings - Xhaka strike inspires Swiss, dominant Mitrovic display\n \n \n \nThe Arsenal midfielder is the younger brother of Taulant Xhaka who plays for Albania and was actually born in Serbia to Albanian parents.\n \nSerbia's relationship with Albania is problematic in itself and perhaps especially so for Xhaka.\n \nIn 2014 when Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama met with Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic in 2014, for the first meeting of it's sorts since 1947, tempers arose as the Albanian PM said that Kosovo's independence was 'undeniable' and was consequently accused of provocation.\n \nWith the undertone of angst between Albanian/Kosovan ancestry and Serbia, the relationship only becomes more poignant when you consider the midfielder's father spent three and half years imprisoned for taking part in demonstrations against Serbia's communist government during the 80s.\n \nOn Instagram Xhaka made the connection to his celebration very clear.\n \n \nA second image said 'We did it bro' with an image of both Xhaka's and Shaqiri's celebration side by side.\n \nThe pair landed themselves in trouble for the celebrations due to the political connotations. After Serbia reported their actions an investigation found that they had infringed on rules and forced them to pay a fine.\n \n'Why doesn't Xhaka do that for Arsenal?' - Gunners fans saying the same thing after wonder goal\n \nFIFA rules state that players will be punished for such statements made in celebration.\n \n \n \n \n \nKeep up to date with the latest news, features and exclusives from football.london via the free football.london app for iPhone and Android.\n \n \n \nAvailable to download from the App Store and Google Play.",

			"body": "The Barclay End Norwich supporters group and fansite Along Come Norwich have launched a crowdfunder campaign to help with their efforts to better project the passion of the Canaries’ faithful at home matches. The groups set a target to raise £3,000, to be used to buy flags, banners and displays for supporters to raise aloft in the Lower Barclay - and potentially the Upper Barclay too. They said clubs in Europe and, closer to home, those such as Nottingham Forest, Watford and Aston Villa had put on similar displays, with the goal of uniting fans, showing support for the Canaries’ players and intimidating the opposition team. And, in less than a week, they outstripped their target. They said they have already set about arranging things for the start of the season. Among the comments from those getting involved on the GoFundMe page were these:. Anthony Faiers said: “Great initiative here. I’ve got a season ticket back in the Barclay for the first time in years, having recently moved back from Dortmund. If there’s one club who know about creating a good atmosphere, it’s them and I fully support you trying to bring some of that to Carrow Road.” David Vickery wrote: “My seat is a long way from the Barclay, but I look forward to seeing the results of this initiative Well done for the positive attitude.” Andrew Rivett-Carnac said: “Excellent initiative. Deserves to be a storming success.” The crowdfunder, however, will stay open, with the organisers saying the more they raise, the more they will be able to do over the course of the season. Barclay End Norwich tweeted: “Thank you so much to everyone who has contributed. Football without fans is nothing, but neither are we.” The first 120 people who donate more than £10 will get a Barclay End Norwich pin badge, while One City Strong T-shirts are being sold, with all profits going into the crowdfunder.",

			"body": " The ash cloud caused by the Saddleworth Moor fire is so big it’s affecting local weather, experts have said. \n \nThe heatwave continued on Wednesday with blazing sunshine and temperatures of 31 degrees in parts of Greater Manchester.\n \n But in Oldham it didn’t get higher than 26 degrees - and in areas immediately under the haze it barely crept above 23C. \n \nMeteorologists say this is down to the thick smoke blocking out the sun, which has burned a spectacular red during the evening in recent days.\n \nLocal weather expert Jon Bayliss, who tweets as @chadweather from Chadderton, told the M.E.N: “The UV here this morning was seven but the haze/smoke arrived and capped the temperature at 23C and dropped the UV to between 2 and 3.\n \n LIVE updates: Firefighters at Saddleworth Moor blaze call in the military to tackle 'biggest fire in living memory' \n \n“It’s cleared a bit now so temps up to 25C and UV levels have risen. Other areas without the haze have touched 28-29C.”\n \nAlex Burkill, from the Met Office, agreed the smoke could be affecting weather.\n \n \n“The fire has been big enough that there’s enough smoke to suppress temperatures a little bit,” he said. &quot;Sunlight cannot get through and so there’s not as much heat.”\n \nIt’s is a similar effect as the cooling often experienced by places after a volcanic eruption.\n \nWhen Indonesia’s Mount Tambora erupted for four months in 1815, experts believe the enormous ash cloud cooled the earth’s temperature by three degrees.\n \n The cause of the Saddleworth Moor fire is still unclear - but moorland managers are linking it to off-road bikers \n \nAcross Europe, Asia and North America, 1816 became known as ‘the year without a summer’ after months of freezing rain and little sunlight.\n \nFIREFIGHTERS CONTINUE TO BATTLE SADDLEWORTH MOOR WILDFIRE \nNevertheless, more than 100 firefighters from Greater Manchester and Derbyshire have faced incredibly difficult conditions as they continue to battle the blaze which has now been burning for four days.\n \nAround 34 homes in Calico Crescent, Stalybridge, were evacuated on Tuesday evening as the inferno was declared a ‘major incident’ by Greater Manchester Police.\n \nSaddleworth moorland fire \nThe fire service said that as of Wednesday, there were seven separate incidents ongoing on areas of the moors, including near Calico Crescent in Carrbrook, Intake Cottage, Intake Lane, Caste Farm, Dovestones, Higher Swineshaw and Chew Road.\n \nThe cause of the fire is still being investigated.",

			"body": "With one pass, Ever Banega succeeded where a country had failed.\n \nLionel Messi, finally unleashed in the final third, struck home the goal that sent Argentina on their way into the knock out stages of the World Cup 2018.\n \nIt was the Barcelona forward's first strike from open play at the tournament, and one of the finest yet seen in Russia this summer - and it would not have been possible without Banega.\n \nHe got his first start against Nigeria, having been left on the bench for the loss to Croatia, and brought on as a sub in the draw to Iceland. While the debate rages on over who is in control of the dug out following stories of a player take over and Jorge Sampaoli's strange behaviour on the touch line, the identity of the decision maker is not important.\n \nNigeria 1-2 Argentina player ratings: Arsenal target Banega stars as Messi's side scrapes through\n \nAll that matters is that the call was made and Messi was finally allowed to play ahead of a footballer capable of thinking on his wavelength and delivering him some proper service from deep.\n \nIt has been a serious issue for the nine-time LaLiga champion at international level for many years. The last time he had a truly great playmaker to rely on to help him shoulder the creative burden of his national team was eight years ago when Juan Sebastian Veron was still on hand to take control in possession, albeit as he played on his last legs at the age of 35. Unfortunately for Messi, his manager that year was Diego Maradona.\n \nWhile Argentina may have reached the final of the World Cup in Brazil four years ago, they did so almost wholly dependent on their super star, with Angel Di Maria supplying plenty of chaos and energy to try and distract opponents. It still all fell to Messi when a touch more craft was needed.\n \n \n \n \nBanega has at last been allowed to fill that niche for Sampaoli and the change in flow, rythmn and fortune has already been obvious. Argentina looked a broken side with no hope of escaping the group stage. They now at least look akward to play against - a wounded animal with a puncher's chance if not a true contender.\n \nEven Messi can't do it all by himself. No player can. Cristiano Ronaldo is making an impact in a Portugal team set up to allow him periods of rest in between his explosive moments. Messi has had to be everywhere for his side. Not anymore. Has Sven Mislintat been watching?\n \n&quot;Announce him now&quot; - Arsenal fans go nuts for Ever Banega after majestic assist for Messi\n \nArsenal head coach Unai Emery will already know everything about Banega and his quality. He built his Sevilla side around the Argentinian having previously worked with him at Valencia, and it has been suggested that the Gunners are weighing up whether to sign the 29-year-old or opt for the gritty tenacity of Sampdoria's Lucas Torreira instead.\n \nIn truth, they should move for both players. For one, they offer completely different things. The Uruguayan is a feisty combatant who excels at winning the ball and closing opponents down. Banega is best in possession, threading the ball forward, picking gaps and hurting the opposition with the quality of his passing.\n \nThe transfer that could pave the way for Ever Banega to be reunited with Unai Emery at Arsenal\n \nEmery has already had to wave goodbye to Santi Cazorla and Jack Wilshere is about to leave the Emirates. Granit Xhaka could do with some help in midfield, and Torreira looks to fit the bill as an enforcer capable of playing a bit too.\n \nHowever, the Swiss is currently the only player who can relied upon to conduct the team from deep, and they lack a midfielder capable of filling the hole between the 25-year-old and Mesut Ozil in the middle of the field. Banega can play as the No. 10 behind the striker. He can also knit things together at the centre of the pitch, as he did for Argentina, and has done for other clubs on his CV, including Inter in Serie A.\n \n \n \n \nNot only is he is talented, he can be a canny opponent too. Streetwise in how he draws fouls and uses his ability throw challenges off when he has the ball. Aaron Ramsey and Xhaka will not be able to play every minute of a campaign that will see the Gunners try to battle across all fronts, including the Europa League, for trophies and Champions League football.\n \nHe is good enough to start, of course, and depending on the opposition he would, but having options is still important. In tight games where Arsenal want a player with class to dictate moves in the final third, a more resilient alternative to Ozil would be very useful.\n \nAgainst Nigeria, he ran the game, freeing up Messi to make the runs that were denied to him in the Croatia match when Sampaoli shackled him with too many responsibilities. While his touch and control for the goal was sublime, the pass to play him in was also a wonderful bit of football.\n \n&quot;Announce him now&quot; - Arsenal fans go nuts for Ever Banega after majestic assist for Messi\n \nImagine what Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang could do with that service, or Henrikh Mkhitaryan scampering into the penalty box. The Armenian has already shown himself to be an excellent improviser in front of goal, especially when he was running onto the passes of Paul Pogba and others at Manchester United. His scorpion kick rivalled that of Olivier Giroud's own heel-struck effort.\n \nWhat's more, Banega could be available for as little as €20million. That's the fee set by a release clause in his deal with Sevilla - although foreign clubs can have a hard time triggering these agreements as many Premier League clubs have found in recent years.\n \n \n \n \nWith his history of working well under Emery, and the clarity he can offer to teams on the pitch, the midfielder who liberated Lionel Messi against Nigeria is the closest thing to a dead cert that the Gunners are likely to come upon this summer.\n \nArsenal may have other plans in place. They have been linked with Aleksandr Golovin, Stanislav Lobotka and a raft of other playmakers and attacking midfielders.\n \nHowever, Banega is one they cannot afford to dither over if he remains in the conversation among the Emirates hierarchy.\n \nIn one move, with one pass, he changed the course of a tournament for his country. A few hours later Ozil dropped out of the World Cup with Germany, unable to affect their destiny. \n \nEmery's Arsenal could do with a creator more capable of forcing their influence on the game in the moments that matter. Banega can be that player.\n \nWhy Lucas Vazquez is the final piece in the Arsenal jigsaw for Unai Emery and Sven Mislintat\n \nKeep up to date with the latest news, features and exclusives from football.london via the free football.london app for iPhone and Android.\n \nAvailable to download from the App Store and Google Play.",

			"body": "A dozen new Love Island contestants have been revealed ahead of tomorrow night's episode.\n \nThe 12 newbies are set to cause drama and heartache for the current islanders as they could be tempted to stray with the fresh meat.\n \nThe new female islanders are set to populate second villa Casa Amor, with the current boys sent in to meet the new ladies.\n \nMeanwhile the original girls won't be lonely as the new boys are sent into the villa to keep them company.\n \nLast year the boys trip to Casa Amor caused major .drama as both Kem and Marcel had their heads turned by the new girls.\n \nProducers are hoping for the same explosive consequences this year, as the islanders fledging relationships are put to the test.\n \nHere's everything you need to know about the new islanders.\n \nThe Girls \nSavanna Darnell \n \n  \nSavanna is a 22-year-old dancer/singer from Sheffield.\n \nSavanna is looking for a guy she can be herself around and wants to have an &quot;amazing experience&quot; in the villa.\n \nNo stranger to love Savanna has had three long term relationships, with her exes most likely to describe her as &quot;expensive.&quot;\n \nShe said: &quot;They say they end up spending a lot of money. But that’s them spending their money, I don’t ask them to! I’m considered quite unpredictable too. You don’t know from one day to the next what I’ll be like.&quot;\n \nGrace Wardle \n \n  \nGrace is a 25-year-old hairdresser from London.\n \nThe stylist is looking for long-term love in the villa, after only having one serious relationship.\n \nShe believes her eyes and her boobs are her best attributes, saying &quot;Physically my eyes, and my breasts, as I paid for them so if they weren’t great I would be quite annoyed!&quot;\n \nGrace isn't afraid to create drama to get her man, but said she would talk things through with another girl, before going after their partner.\n \nCharlie Williams \n \n  \nCharlie is a 24-year-old tanning assistant from Bath.\n \nCharlie describes what she wants from the villa as &quot;in a nutshell I want someone nice, hard working and someone who wants to be in a genuine relationship.&quot;\n \nAnd she's already got her eye on two of the boys saying: &quot;I really like Alex –I like him more the more that I watch the show. His values are so strong. I think we’d have a lot in common. The new guy Sam also seems really funny; I think I would get on with him.&quot;\n \nKazimir Crossley \n \n  \nKazimir is a 23-year-old make-up artist from London.\n \nKazimir has done last year's winner Kem's make-up before and has been asking him for tips ahead of her entrance to the show.\n \nGeorgia best watch out as Kazimir has already set her eyes on Josh, saying: &quot;I want to find an honest guy because I’ve come across so many liars. I like to be looked after. In the villa, I fancy Josh.&quot;\n \nAdam's antics also failed to impress Kazimir, as she said: &quot;What Adam did to Rosie puts me off, he gets what he wants and he needs to learn you can’t always get what you want.&quot;\n \nEllie Jones \n \n  \nThe 22-year-old admin assistant will be familiar to one islander - as she used to go out with Jack.\n \nSpeaking about their relationship she said: &quot;I was seeing Jack Fincham on and off. We met in August 2016 and dated on and off for a while.\n \n&quot;We have always spoken because we got on so well. I actually spoke to him as a friend about two days before he went into the villa and had no idea he was going on the show!\n \n&quot;We weren’t in an official relationship but we spoke about it, would go on dates and kept trying to make it work but it wouldn’t.\n \n&quot;I met his brother and mates. I don’t know how he’ll feel when he sees me walk in.\n \n&quot;I don’t know if he’ll be angry or shocked but we do get on so hopefully it won’t be an issue. When I look at him, I do still think there is something there but I would never go back there.&quot;\n \nWhile she might not be keen to rekindle things with Jack Ellie has got her eyes on another two islanders.\n \nShe said: &quot;I fancy Josh. And I really fancy Alex because he’s so different to my normal type, I think I’m in love with him already and I’ve not even met him yet! He makes my heart melt, he’ll be a good person to bring home to my parents.&quot;\n \nDarylle Sargeant \n \n  \nDarylle is a 24-year-old eyebrow technician from Watford.\n \nDarylle used to date Towie star Dean Ralph and says the pair have remained friends.\n \nThe tattoo loving babe is keen to find a kindred spirit in the villa and already knows who she wants, saying: &quot;I like tall, dark and handsome! I am really tattooed so I love heavily tattooed guys but I also like people who have good chat and banter, someone who isn’t too serious.\n \n&quot;In the villa, I've got my eye on Adam, he is beautiful. I like Jack too and Josh.&quot;\n \n \n \nTwitter reacts to the return of Love Island 2018 \n \n \nLove Island \n \n \nThe Boys \nJordan Adefeyisan \n \nJordan is a 23-year-old model from Stockport.\n \nHe describes his ideal girl as &quot;A nice girl, with good banter and who I can click with properly. In the villa, I fancy Ellie, Megan and Georgia is fit as well. I know they are coupled up but it's all a game isn't it...&quot;\n \nJordan has never had a serious relationship, but hates girls with attitude who think they are better than other people.\n \nCharlie Brake \n \nCharlie is a 23-year-old socialite from Chelsea.\n \nCharlie has already got his eye on Ellie and Megan in the villa and says he thinks people may be jealous of his family fortune.\n \nHe said: &quot;I think a lot of people when they find out about my background, there might be a lot of jealousy there.\n \n&quot;My grandfather founded a food distribution company called Brakes which my family own and we sold it so everyone is well looked after.\n \n&quot;I visit my Dad in Monaco a lot and spend a lot of time in the French Alps.&quot;\n \nCharlie has a Scouse ex, who will be surprised to see him on the show, as he explained: &quot;I met another girl who was from Liverpool and ended up being with her for about a year and half and moved to America with her for a bit.\n \n&quot;Then it came to end. I reckon they’ll be surprised to see me on Love Island.&quot;\n \nFrankie Foster \n \n  \nFrankie is a 22-year-old business management student and fitness coach from Cheltenham.\n \nFrankie used to play semi-professional rugby and says he's not the &quot;stereotypical lad in skinny jeans and tight T shirts.&quot;\n \nEllie and Zara are the girls who have caught his attention as he described what he wants from the villa as: &quot;I’d like to end up finding someone I really like. I change my mind in terms of who I like every time I watch it –but at the moment it is probably Ellie and Zara.\n \n&quot;They both seem cool and chatty. They’re most similar to my usual type.&quot;\n \nJack Fowler \n \n  \nJack in a 22-year-old semi-professional footballer from London.\n \nJack previously starred in a Tom Zanetti music video and is looking forward to his villa experience.\n \nKeeping his cards close to his chest about his villa crush Jack said he was looking for a &quot;brunette girl who is curvy with a nice bum and a nice smile and nice eyes. But we also need a connection.&quot;\n \nPreviously Jack has lied about his age to get a girl, he said: &quot;I wanted to be with a girl who was a bit older than me so when I was 19, 20, I changed my age on Tinder to 25.\n \n&quot;I met a girl on there who was 24 and we had a date but when I got my wallet out to pay, she checked my ID and her face dropped when she saw I was younger than I’d said.&quot;\n \nAlex Miller \n \n  \nAlex is a 28-year-old structural glazier from Essex.\n \nAlex describes himself as &quot;pretty perfect&quot; and says petite brunettes are his type.\n \nHe said: &quot;In the villa I like Dani. I like Ellie too, she’s cute. Dani is very coupled up with Jack so we’ll have to see how coupled up they really are when I go in…&quot;\n \nAlex's advice to girls who want to woo him is: &quot;Be bubbly, I don’t like boring birds. As long as they are funny and have a good personality. When it comes to my ideal date, I’ve got a great first date that I’ve done a few times – drinks in the city, onto a comedy show and then more drinks. I’ve got a good success ratio with that one!&quot;\n \nDean Overson \n \n  \n  \nDean is a 25-year-old car salesman from Burnley.\n \nNewly single Dean is excited to have some fun in the villa and has his eye on several girls.\n \nHe said: &quot;I like nice eyes and I want a girl to have a bit about them, someone you can speak to and who can hold a conversation.\n \n&quot;I like Megan and I’d go for Ellie. Zara is beautiful as well. I think all of the girls are lovely in their own way.&quot;\n \nDean's turn-offs are loud girls, as he said: &quot;Someone who is very loud and a bit too much. And also if a girl thinks she is better than what she is. Like when you’re out and trying to speak to a girl and she is arrogant.&quot;\n \n*Love Island continues on ITV2 at 9pm\n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n ",

			"body": " Campaigners are fighting for the future of a unique and troubled secondary school in Co Armagh. \n \n They are calling on the Education Authority to preserve the Lurgan campus of Craigavon Senior High School, which is the only school in the UK that caters solely for GCSE students. \n \nCraigavon Senior High School was developed across two sites in Lurgan and Portadown as part of the pioneering Dickson Plan, which has offered a two-tier system of junior and senior high schools since the 1960s, effectively deferring selection to age 14.\n \n The senior school caters for 579 GCSE pupils, the majority of whom are on the Portadown site. \n \nThe row began in 2016 when governors considered closing the Lurgan site after concerns were raised around health and safety, safeguarding and sustainability. They wanted to transport pupils by bus to the sister site in Portadown.\n \n 1,000 people sign petition rejecting plans for four-schools amalgamation \n \nBut the proposal was dropped following a backlash by parents who insisted their children continue their education in Lurgan.\n \nInstead, they wanted the Education Authority to consider moving the children to temporary accommodation on the site of the junior school in Lurgan.\n \nParents claim the school has deteriorated due to a lack of investment by education officials amid continued uncertainty over its future.\n \nThey warn the current site is so &quot;unfit for purpose&quot; that children must &quot;eat their lunch between parked cars&quot; due to lack of outdoor space.\n \nComparing children in the small school yard to &quot;caged animals at a zoo&quot;, they have called for the immediate resignation of the schools' governors who they accused of failing the children.\n \n Hundreds protest in Belfast at plans to merge special schools \n \nCommunity representative Norman Mawhinney said there was widespread concern about uncertainty over the school's future.\n \nHe added: &quot;Our local sports clubs and politicians all agree with the need to keep these children in Lurgan.\n \n&quot;What we do not want is for them to continue to be educated in these awful conditions. People are prepared to fight for what they want for their children. We are stepping up our campaign by calling on governors to step aside.&quot;\n \n Belfast dad appeals for a potentially lifesaving donor for his seriously ill daughter \n \nMLA Doug Beattie claimed the issues affecting the senior Lurgan campus had been &quot;obvious for 15 years&quot;.\n \nHe said: &quot;The Lurgan campus was only supposed to be a temporary solution years ago when the Dickson plan was rolled out.\n \n&quot;It does not have playing fields, the pupils have to eat their lunches between parked cars and there are safeguarding concerns around its proximity to the Southern Regional College.\n \n Education chiefs warned to stop intruding on 'Catholic grammar schools' amid Co Down 'super school' plans \n \n&quot;It is a sorry state of affairs. The problem is that instead of fixing the issues at the school, it has been allowed to run down.&quot;\n \nHe added: &quot;Pupils cannot stay where they are because the school is not fit for purpose, but bussing them to Portadown is not the solution.\n \n&quot;Many of these children come from disadvantaged backgrounds and are the most vulnerable academically.\n \n&quot;There is a feeling that the Dickson Plan gives everything to the 60 per cent who are selected for grammar college and the rest are being neglected, it is truly awful.&quot;\n \n Smart hubs coming to Belfast city centre \n \nThe principal of Craigavon Senior High School was unavailable for comment but an Education Authority spokesman said: “There is broad agreement across all stakeholders that short, medium and long-term action is required in relation to the Lurgan campus of Craigavon Senior High School.\n \n“We will continue to support the staff and governors of Craigavon Senior High School as they seek to continue to improve standards and care for the pupils on both campuses.\n \n&quot;Craigavon Senior High School is an important part of the Dickson Plan family of schools and will continue to receive the support it requires.\n \n“In the longer term, any proposal for change will be subject to a full consultation process and we will continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders.”\n \n Parents urged to talk about stranger danger following 'sexting' incident \n \n Keep up-to-date with all the very latest news, what's on, sport and everything else in Belfast and beyond with the Belfast Live app. \n \n Only select news that interests you by picking the topics you want to display on the app's homepage.

			"body": "It's official. Almost a year on from agreeing a deal with RB Leipzig to sign him, Liverpool have officially unveiled Naby Keita.\n \nThe Guinea international has already been hyped to high heaven as a player who can take Jurgen Klopp's team to the next level, as serious competitors for the Premier League, the Champions League and a threat to Manchester City and their dominance over the English topflight.\n \nDuring his time in the Bundesliga, the 23-year-old marked himself out as one of the most exciting talents in Europe in his position. If a mad scientist were to create a midfielder fit for the modern game, splicing together bits and pieces from other top players, they would struggle to come up with a better end product than the Guinean.\n \n Why Arsenal were never interested in signing Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini \n \nHe can dribble past opponents and keep the ball like Tottenham Hotspur's Mousa Dembele. When in possession, he has a wonderful eye for a killer pass to evade defenders, not unlike David Silva. \n \nDespite standing at only five-foot-eight, he can shrug off opponents and surge into the final third as Kevin De Bruyne and Paul Pogba often do for the Manchester clubs. His father gave him the middle name of &quot;Deco&quot; given his resemblance to the former Porto, Barcelona and Chelsea playmaker as a footballer.\n \n \n \n \nKeita is quick, clever and hard-working and arrives at Liverpool having already proven his ability to be a match-winner for Leipzig, closing down the opposition.\n \nFor Jurgen Klopp, he will replace the gold dust qualities of Philippe Coutinho as a player who can make something out of nothing while also slotting into the German's demands for a high press to put other teams under serious pressure, home and away.\n \n&quot;A complete No. 8,&quot; was the description given by Michel Dussuyer, who handed Keita his first international cap in 2014, as reported by the official Bundesliga website. \n \n Who is Gelson Martins? - The Arsenal and Liverpool transfer target who could sign for free \n \nOver the last two seasons he has scored 14 goals and bagged 12 assists in the German topflight and ranks as one of Europe's most prolific and effective dribblers.\n \nSo what do Arsenal, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Fulham, Tottenham Hotspur, Watford and West Ham need to worry about when it comes to facing Keita next season?\n \nWhere does Naby Keita play? \nFor RB Leipzig, Keita usually played as one of the central midfielders in front of their back four.\n \nThe Bundesliga outfit play an aggressive and expansive brand of football focused around fast breaks and intense pressing to win the ball high up the field.\n \nMarcel Sabitzer and Arsenal target Emil Forsberg would be deployed ahead of Keita and his more defensive partner Diego Demme. It was their job to peel away to run the channels or pick out their teammates with deliveries from the half space, where Mesut Ozil and De Bruyne often roam in the Premier League.\n \n Mesut Ozil's struggles for Germany at the World Cup 2018 show why he needs Unai Emery \n \nFor Liverpool, Keita could replace Emre Can as the more dynamic midfielder alongside Jordan Henderson. The England international would hope to build a similar on-field relationship to the one that the Guinean enjoyed with Demme. Fabinho is another option to partner the former Leipzig man.\n \nAlternatively, he could be sent further up the pitch to play that role that Adam Lallana often takes up when fit as an attacking midfielder tasked with triggering the press behind Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino.\n \nWhat is Naby Keita's style of play? \nKeita is a box-to-box midfielder with a low centre of gravity, good pace and an excellent eye for a pass. He moves well and regularly makes runs into the final third in the hopes of creating or scoring goals.\n \nYet unlike other attacking midfielders, he works hard off the ball and contributes to his team's defensive efforts, intercepting threats and challenging opponents to win back possession.\n \n Andreas Christensen scouting report: Defender now gives Maurizio Sarri more options in midfield \n \nHis standard mode of play is to bring the ball forward from deep, either running in possession or playing short, simple passes to advance the play up the pitch where he can use his strength on the ball and dribbling ability to take opponents out of the game in tight spaces.\n \nEven when he isn't able to get past his markers, he usually wins a foul to put his colleagues in a dangerous position for a freekick.\n \nWhat are Naby Keita's weaknesses? \nThe Guinean's lack of height can be an issue although any players who have spent time alongside him will know that passing to his feet is an easy solution to that flaw - and Santi Cazorla and Silva have shown just how dominant diminutively-framed midfielders can be in the Premier League in recent years for Arsenal and Manchester City, respectively.\n \n How Lucas Torreira will unlock Granit Xhaka's true potential at Arsenal under Unai Emery \n \nHowever, one fault that isn't so easily covered for is Keita's indiscipline. The midfielder picked up 15 yellow cards and two reds in his two seasons in the German topflight.\n \nIf he can be put under pressure and made to feel as if the world is against him, especially when decisions don't go his way, his reactions can get the better of him. Think Roy Keane.\n \nHow to stop Naby Keita \nWest Ham look set to be the first London club to face the Guinean in a Liverpool shirt when they face the Reds on August 11 at Anfield.\n \nManuel Pellegrini will need to make sure his defence has plenty of cover, not only to deter Salah and his wing-mates, but to stop Keita building up the momentum he thrives on by working the play forward from deep to explode into the final third to cause chaos. \n \nThat's easier said than done but it will be key to have at least one extra player in midfielder to plug gaps, close down his options and keep tabs on him. No wonder the Irons have been linked with moves for a number of midfielders to reinforce their options.\n \n Steven N'Zonzi showed why Chelsea and Arsenal have looked elsewhere following France display \n \nNext up could be Crystal Palace, who already have Luka Milivojevic to try and guard their own defenders but will need a big shift from their wingers and attacking players to try and unsettle Keita and disrupt his passing game higher up the pitch, before he becomes a problem for the Eagles in their own half. \n \nAugust 18 is the date. Selhurst Park will be the venue.\n \nSpurs face Liverpool on September 15, and spectators could be in for a treat as Keita comes up against the likes of Dele Alli, Eric Dier and Mousa Dembele, or whoever is signed to replace the Belgian if he departs in the transfer window.\n \n Mateo Kovacic is the readymade upgrade on Mousa Dembele that Spurs cannot miss out on this summer \n \nMauricio Pochettino's side have often cancelled out Klopp and his Liverpool team and this should be another contest that relies upon individual battles being won, especially in midfield.\n \nChelsea host Liverpool on September 29 and given the uncertainty over who will be taking charge next season, it's hard to say what shape they will line up in or how their approach could change, but N'Golo Kante will undoubtedly be important in any battle to contain Keita.\n \nTheir duel would be akin to an immovable object meeting an unstoppable force and could be a fascinating encounter.\n \n No new manager, no signings, no direction: Chelsea set for their most frustrating summer yet \n \nArsenal are set to welcome Liverpool to the Emirates on November 3. If Unai Emery has signed another midfielder by the time of the visit, Klopp and Keita may be faced with another day of one-on-one battles as Granit Xhaka, Aaron Ramsey and a third player, perhaps Lucas Torreira, step up to the plate.\n \nFulham and Watford have to wait until November 10 and November 24, respectively, to take on the Reds. The Cottagers are likely to try and fight fire with fire and be positive, playing on the front-foot to hope their fast attackers can pose questions at the other end while the Hornets have players of their own to put forward to counter Keita in Abdoulaye Doucoure and Nathaniel Chalobah.\n \nNo matter the personnel available to his opponents, Keita is set to be a headache for London clubs to deal with over the course of the season to come.\n \n Why Lucas Vazquez is the final piece in the Arsenal jigsaw for Unai Emery and Sven Mislintat \n \nKeep up to date with the latest news, features and exclusives from football.london via the free football.london app for iPhone and Android.\n \nAvailable to download from the App Store and Google Play.",

			"body": "Arsenal fans may just want to hold off before getting Ozil No.11 printed on their shirt ahead of next season.\n \nWhile there is little chance of the German international leaving the Emirates having penned a new long-term contract back in February, a change of squad number could well be on the cards before the big kick-off in August.\n \nPetr Cech, Hector Bellerin, Mohamed Elneny and Granit Xhaka have all taken on new shirt numbers following a number of exits, while Stephan Lichtsteiner will wear the No.12 jersey from next season.\n \nWith only a few squad numbers available at present, including the No.3 and No.5 shirts, one famous number at Arsenal has just become available following Jack Wilshere's decision to end his long association with the Gunners.\n \nWorn by Paul Merson, Dennis Bergkamp and Robin van Persie in the past, as well as defender William Gallas for four seasons, Wilshere's exit means that the No.10 shirt is now up for grabs.\n \n \n \n \nMesut Ozil has made no secret of his desire to wear the shirt since his arrival back in 2013 and he previously spoke about what the number meant to him having inherited it for the German national team.\n \n&quot;For me, the number means a lot. It’s my favourite number,&quot; he said. \n \n&quot;Football legends such as Zinedine Zidane, Diego Maradona or Pele wore that number on the back. I’m really happy about it.\n \n&quot;Of course I have previously given those in charge a signal. The number is right for me and my position as a playmaker.&quot;\n \nAlthough the German is currently on World Cup duty with his country, don't be surprised if he sent the club a quick message about acquiring the shirt number upon hearing about Wilshere's exit.\n \n Transfer news live: Emery says 'yes' to &pound;21m Arsenal deal, star says he chooses Man United \n \nThe 29-year-old, who has worn the No.11 shirt since signing from Real Madrid five years ago, is desperate to get his hands on the top and now it looks like he will finally get his wish.\n \nIn fact, Ozil had even wanted the shirt number following Wilshere's loan move to Bournemouth during the 2016/17 season.\n \nSpeaking to German publication Kicker, he said: &quot;Since Wilshere’s departure last summer, the number is free, but I have yet to get it.&quot;\n \nIn a further interview with the Express, he added: &quot;[The No.10] has become free and I definitely want it.&quot;\n \n \n \n \nGiven clubs don't usually assign the squad numbers for players that have departed on loan, Ozil was made to wait.\n \nReports had even suggested last year that the player would only sign a new long-term contract with the club providing he could take on Wilshere's shirt number.\n \nHaving worn the shirt during his time with Real Madrid and on international duty with Germany, it looks like Arsenal will have a new No.10 on the pitch come the opening day against Manchester City.\n \n Unai Emery gives Arsenal the green light to launch &pound;21m bid for World Cup 2018 star - report \n \n \n \nKeep up to date with the latest news, features and exclusives from football.london via the free football.london app for iPhone and Android.\n \nAvailable to download from the App Store and Google Play.",

			"body": "  As a child, Meiner wanted to be a barrister. She was very intelligent and everybody around her thought she would go far. \n \nHowever, at the age of 13, she was prescribed Valium, which is used to treat anxiety, following her father’s death.\n \nIt ruined her life. Four decades later, aged 55, she sees a direct link from that valium to the sleeping tablets and painkillers she would take as a young woman and ultimately heroin.\n \n Meiner lives in Cwmgors in Neath Port Talbot . Her story is a chilling one about the consequences of additiction and the challenges addicts face. \n \n \n“Valium was my first drug - looking back, Valium ruined my teenage years,” she added. “At the time, doctors didn’t realise how addictive they were.\n \n“I was a very intelligent kid and everybody thought I would go very far.\n \n“When I was eight or nine, I remember wanting to be a barrister. I do blame the doctors for giving me Valium at such young age.”\n \nShe describes her upbringing as &quot;ok&quot; and says she dropped out of school at the age of 16 to work in a motor factory, making components for cars.\n \n When she was around 26 or 27, she was prescribed Temazepam, a sleeping tablet. At the time she was working in a nursing home in Ammanford and she quickly got addicted to the jelly-like painkillers as well. \n \n“With all the medication, I haven’t got much of a memory. I find it hard to look that back,” Meiner said, finding it hard to recollect much detail.\n \n Heroin and a Welsh town: Addiction, violence and tragedy in a small corner of Wales \n \nMeiner was 30 when she first tried heroin; she couldn’t get Valium or Temazepam so she turned to the class A drug.\n \nAs she suffers from anxiety and depression, she used heroin to self-medicate her mental health. She felt heroin helped her relax and helped her with her depression.\n \nAs a heroin addict, it was hard, Meiner said. At the time, she was living in Swindon as she had had to flee an abusive relationship. At first, Meiner was still able to keep agency work, working in nursing homes.\n \n“The first time I had heroin, I can remember thinking this is the drug for me because it calms me down,” she said. “Despite all the medication, I was still a bit hyper.”\n \n \n \nAt her worst, Meiner was spending &pound;100 a day on heroin. She would fund her habit through her partners, who she said would be dealing drugs or would go out stealing to get money for heroin.\n \nShe has never been one to use drugs in crowds, Meiner said, she was more of a “secret user”.\n \n“I didn’t want to show because I was embarrassed,” she continued. “I only ever took heroin - if I was a drinker, I would be dead now.”\n \nIn her mid 40s, Meiner moved back to Wales, which is when she first went into treatment. At one point, she went to a rehab clinic in Weston Super Mare.\n \n“I have been trying to get clean for 15 years,” she said. “There is a lot of stigma around being a heroin addict, it is not something I am proud of.”\n \n Original journalism from WalesOnline... \n \nMeiner said she hasn’t touched heroin since February this year, when she was prescribed Subutex, used to treat opioid addiction, via Dyfodol - part of the Kaleidoscope group and which provides the prescribing service for the criminal justice system. She has been travelling to Neath to get the drug every day since then.\n \nMeiner, who was convicted for shoplifting offences years ago, is only able to get help through the criminal justice system as the community drug and alcohol team class her to be an immediate threat following a series of disputes.\n \nThe health board would not comment on Meinir's case when we approached it but referred us to their guidance on process.\n \nIt states: &quot;When a referral is received a risk assessment is completed by the clinical team to determine if treatment can be safely provided. Where this is not considered possible the patient is signposted to alternative appropriate services.”\n \nBecause Meinir is being treated under through the criminal justice system, she said her treatment will be cut off in February 2019 after one year.\n \nShe finds it hard to keep going when she feels the help is going to be cut off while she still needs it, adding she will be forced to buy Subutex off the streets, which will cost her &pound;10 a day.\n \n \nMeiner - who is from the Ammanford area originally - wishes she could continue the treatment through the community addiction teams.\n \n“My life would be easier if I was just taking heroin but I don’t want to,” she added. “It shouldn’t be a battle to get treatment. It is a continuous fight to stay clean.”\n \nMeiner - who hasn’t worked for more than fifteen years but has volunteered in charity shops - said she was first prescribed Subutex in 2013 and that when she was taken off the drug then, she had repeated nervous breakdowns.\n \n From a life of crime to international rugby - the stunning tale of redemption that does Wales proud \n \nThe 55-year-old said: “I am petrified because the medication ends in February next year. I have been fighting to get clean and get medication.\n \n“They are denying me treatment. At the end of the year, I am going to be another statistic of death.\n \n“I worry about it every single day. I have had to cut my hair short because I was getting into such state that I was pulling my hair out.\n \n“Life was easier on heroin, which is absurd.”\n \n \nMartin Blakebrough, CEO of Kaleidoscope, said the key problem with some services is that they are very quick to ban.\n \n“In normal circumstances, like attending A&amp;E, I could understand but there seems little allowance for mental illness, or temporary illness that can make people difficult,” he added. “In this case my understanding is that Meiner has made threats which have led her to been banned for life from the community drug and alcohol team.\n \n“I cannot understand how anyone can be banned for life regardless of the threat. The reality is many people we work with have significant mental health issues which does mean they are volatile.”\n \nMr Blakebrough said that Meiner has treatment with Dyfodol until February and, provided they can still manage her needs, they would hope that the commissioners in the area would allow them to continue her treatment if that was her wish.\n \n“I think it is vital that people such as Meiner are given as much support to maintain treatment as possible because the cost of not doing is too high for her and the community,” he continued. “As the Government have announced more community sentences for women we need to plan better to support the most needy in our community and not shut the door on them and their possible progress.”\n \nKaren Jones, chair of the Western Bay Area Planning Board, said it would not be appropriate for her to discuss an individual case.\n \nShe said: “The APB seeks to be assured that services are delivered appropriately to meet people’s needs, that there is good liaison with criminal justice services and that any complaints are addressed properly.”",

I met his brother and mates. I don't know how he'll feel when he sees me walk in.\n \n&quot;I don't know if he'll be angry or shocked but we do get on so hopefully it won't be an issue.\n \n&quot;When I look at him, I do still think there is something there but I would never go back there.&quot;\n \n \nShe is one of 12 new contestants set to stir up drama on the dating series and said she has her eye on Josh Denzel and doctor Alex George, saying of the medic: &quot;He's so different to my normal type, I think I'm in love with him already and I've not even met him yet!\n \n Two Love Island stars will be booted off show tonight - and they might not even be a couple \n \n&quot;He makes my heart melt, he'll be a good person to bring home to my parents.&quot;\n \nAlso joining the show will be 22-year-old dancer Savanna Darnell, from Sheffield, and 25-year-old hairdresser Grace Wardle from London, as well as make-up artist Kazimir Crossley, 23, also from London.\n \nThey will be accompanied by Charlie Williams, 24, a tanning shop assistant from Bath, who is also keen on Alex and new arrival Sam Bird.\n \n \n \nTwitter Reacts: Niall leaves Love Island \n \n \nShe said: &quot;I really like Alex - I like him more the more that I watch the show. His values are so strong.

I am really tattooed so I love heavily tattooed guys but I also like people who have good chat and banter, someone who isn't too serious.\n \n&quot;In the villa, I've got my eye on Adam, he is beautiful. I like Jack too and Josh.&quot;\n \n \n \nLove Island 2018 \n \n \nHere's everything you need to know about the new islanders.\n \nThe Girls \nSavanna Darnell \n \nSavanna is a 22-year-old dancer/singer from Sheffield.\n \nSavanna is looking for a guy she can be herself around and wants to have an &quot;amazing experience&quot; in the villa.\n \nNo stranger to love Savanna has had three long term relationships, with her exes most likely to describe her as &quot;expensive.&quot;\n \nShe said: &quot;They say they end up spending a lot of money. But that’s them spending their money, I don’t ask them to! I’m considered quite unpredictable too. You don’t know from one day to the next what I’ll be like.&quot;\n \nGrace Wardle \n \nGrace is a 25-year-old hairdresser from London.\n \nThe stylist is looking for long-term love in the villa, after only having one serious relationship.\n \nShe believes her eyes and her boobs are her best attributes, saying &quot;Physically my eyes, and my breasts, as I paid for them so if they weren’t great I would be quite annoyed!&quot;\n \nGrace isn't afraid to create drama to get her man, but said she would talk things through with another girl, before going after their partner.\n \nCharlie Williams \n \nCharlie is a 24-year-old tanning assistant from Bath.\n \nCharlie describes what she wants from the villa as &quot;in a nutshell I want someone nice, hard working and someone who wants to be in a genuine relationship.&quot;\n \nAnd she's already got her eye on two of the boys saying: &quot;I really like Alex –I like him more the more that I watch the show. His values are so strong. I think we’d have a lot in common. The new guy Sam also seems really funny; I think I would get on with him.&quot;\n \nKazimir Crossley \n \nKazimir is a 23-year-old make-up artist from London.\n \nKazimir has done last year's winner Kem's make-up before and has been asking him for tips ahead of her entrance to the show.\n \nGeorgia best watch out as Kazimir has already set her eyes on Josh, saying: &quot;I want to find an honest guy because I’ve come across so many liars. I like to be looked after. In the villa, I fancy Josh.&quot;\n \nAdam's antics also failed to impress Kazimir, as she said: &quot;What Adam did to Rosie puts me off, he gets what he wants and he needs to learn you can’t always get what you want.&quot;\n \nEllie Jones \n \nThe 22-year-old admin assistant will be familiar to one islander - as she used to go out with Jack.\n \nSpeaking about their relationship she said: &quot;I was seeing Jack Fincham on and off. We met in August 2016 and dated on and off for a while.\n \n&quot;We have always spoken because we got on so well. I actually spoke to him as a friend about two days before he went into the villa and had no idea he was going on the show!\n \n&quot;We weren’t in an official relationship but we spoke about it, would go on dates and kept trying to make it work but it wouldn’t.\n \n&quot;I met his brother and mates. I don’t know how he’ll feel when he sees me walk in.\n \n&quot;I don’t know if he’ll be angry or shocked but we do get on so hopefully it won’t be an issue. When I look at him, I do still think there is something there but I would never go back there.&quot;\n \nWhile she might not be keen to rekindle things with Jack Ellie has got her eyes on another two islanders.\n \nShe said: &quot;I fancy Josh. And I really fancy Alex because he’s so different to my normal type, I think I’m in love with him already and I’ve not even met him yet! He makes my heart melt, he’ll be a good person to bring home to my parents.&quot;\n \nDarylle Sargeant \n \nDarylle is a 24-year-old eyebrow technician from Watford.\n \nDarylle used to date Towie star Dean Ralph and says the pair have remained friends.\n \nThe tattoo loving babe is keen to find a kindred spirit in the villa and already knows who she wants, saying: &quot;I like tall, dark and handsome! I am really tattooed so I love heavily tattooed guys but I also like people who have good chat and banter, someone who isn’t too serious.\n \n&quot;In the villa, I've got my eye on Adam, he is beautiful. I like Jack too and Josh.&quot;\n \nThe Boys \nJordan Adefeyisan \n \nJordan is a 23-year-old model from Stockport.\n \nHe describes his ideal girl as &quot;A nice girl, with good banter and who I can click with properly. In the villa, I fancy Ellie, Megan and Georgia is fit as well. I know they are coupled up but it's all a game isn't it...&quot;\n \nJordan has never had a serious relationship, but hates girls with attitude who think they are better than other people.\n \nCharlie Brake \n \nCharlie is a 23-year-old socialite from Chelsea.\n \nCharlie has already got his eye on Ellie and Megan in the villa and says he thinks people may be jealous of his family fortune.\n \nHe said: &quot;I think a lot of people when they find out about my background, there might be a lot of jealousy there.\n \n&quot;My grandfather founded a food distribution company called Brakes which my family own and we sold it so everyone is well looked after.\n \n&quot;I visit my Dad in Monaco a lot and spend a lot of time in the French Alps.&quot;\n \nCharlie has a Scouse ex, who will be surprised to see him on the show, as he explained: &quot;I met another girl who was from Liverpool and ended up being with her for about a year and half and moved to America with her for a bit.\n \n&quot;Then it came to end. I reckon they’ll be surprised to see me on Love Island.&quot;\n \nFrankie Foster \n \nFrankie is a 22-year-old business management student and fitness coach from Cheltenham.\n \nFrankie used to play semi-professional rugby and says he's not the &quot;stereotypical lad in skinny jeans and tight T shirts.&quot;\n \nEllie and Zara are the girls who have caught his attention as he described what he wants from the villa as: &quot;I’d like to end up finding someone I really like. I change my mind in terms of who I like every time I watch it –but at the moment it is probably Ellie and Zara.\n \n&quot;They both seem cool and chatty. They’re most similar to my usual type.&quot;\n \nJack Fowler \n \nJack in a 22-year-old semi-professional footballer from London.\n \nJack previously starred in a Tom Zanetti music video and is looking forward to his villa experience.\n \nKeeping his cards close to his chest about his villa crush Jack said he was looking for a &quot;brunette girl who is curvy with a nice bum and a nice smile and nice eyes. But we also need a connection.&quot;\n \nPreviously Jack has lied about his age to get a girl, he said: &quot;I wanted to be with a girl who was a bit older than me so when I was 19, 20, I changed my age on Tinder to 25.\n \n&quot;I met a girl on there who was 24 and we had a date but when I got my wallet out to pay, she checked my ID and her face dropped when she saw I was younger than I’d said.&quot;\n \nAlex Miller \n \nAlex is a 28-year-old structural glazier from Essex.\n \nAlex describes himself as &quot;pretty perfect&quot; and says petite brunettes are his type.\n \nHe said: &quot;In the villa I like Dani. I like Ellie too, she’s cute. Dani is very coupled up with Jack so we’ll have to see how coupled up they really are when I go in…&quot;\n \nAlex's advice to girls who want to woo him is: &quot;Be bubbly, I don’t like boring birds. As long as they are funny and have a good personality. When it comes to my ideal date, I’ve got a great first date that I’ve done a few times – drinks in the city, onto a comedy show and then more drinks. I’ve got a good success ratio with that one!&quot;\n \nDean Overson \n \nDean is a 25-year-old car salesman from Burnley.\n \nNewly single Dean is excited to have some fun in the villa and has his eye on several girls.\n \nHe said: &quot;I like nice eyes and I want a girl to have a bit about them, someone you can speak to and who can hold a conversation.\n \n&quot;I like Megan and I’d go for Ellie. Zara is beautiful as well. I think all of the girls are lovely in their own way.&quot;\n \nDean's turn-offs are loud girls, as he said: &quot;Someone who is very loud and a bit too much. And also if a girl thinks she is better than what she is. Like when you’re out and trying to speak to a girl and she is arrogant.&quot;\n \nLove Island continues on ITV2 at 9pm. The new arrivals will appear during Thursday's episode.",

			"body": "Heidi Allen has asked the Prime Minister to set up a dedicated taskforce to tackle the chaos blighting Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) services.\n \nThe South Cambridgeshire MP read out an email from a constituent detailing his nightmare journey to London at Prime Minister's Questions today (June 27).\n \nMrs Allen has also joined two other MPs in writing to the Government to demand an urgent response to service failures.\n \nBritish rail users travelling on Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern - all run by GTR - have been hit by delays and cancellations since the failed introduction of new timetables in May.\n \nGTR has apologised for the ongoing problems and said it is working to launch an improved temporary timetable in July.\n \n \nSpeaking in the Commons this afternoon, Mrs Allen said: &quot;At 6.49 am my constituent, James Wheatcroft, emailed me to say: 'I am currently standing at Shepreth station. 06.40 has just arrived. 05.38, 06.10 and 07.25 bus cancelled so this is on the only train to London this morning until the 8.10.'\n \n&quot;'Five people have been on the platform for over an hour and missed their Eurostar connection. The station car park is totally empty - people giving up and working from home.'\n \n&quot;At 7.29 am he sent another message: 'Our train has now broken down. Another train has arrived but there is not enough room for everyone.'\n \n”At 7.59 am, he said that the rest of the passengers had to get train back north, there was no room for them on that either and that 'people simply decided to go home'.&quot;\n \nI've given up on trains entirely - they're always late\n \nMrs Allen added: &quot;Please, Prime Minister - assurances from Govia Thameslink Railway are not enough. We need a taskforce to micromanage these contracts back to performance. Will she please commit to that?\n \nTheresa May said she recognised Mrs Allen's concerns and said that passengers' experience had been unacceptable.\n \n \nShe added: &quot;The Department for Transport has been working on this issue with GTR, and it is working to provide a new timetable, which will provide more capacity on the services, but it is not the same timetable that was originally introduced in May.\n \n&quot;The Department for Transport will continue to work to ensure that the rail company is providing the performance that passengers rightly expect and deserve.&quot;\n \nA letter signed by Mrs Allen, Sir Oliver Heald, MP for North East Hertfordshire and Jonathan Djanogly, MP for Huntingdon highlighted their &quot;concern and disappointment&quot; at the five weeks of issues being faced by commuters.\n \n12,000 train journeys cancelled as rail misery continues across the UK\n \nWriting to transport minister Jo Johnson, the MPs said they had received a &quot;substantial&quot; amount of complaints from constituents.\n \nThese include cancelled trains at rush hour, trains too full to board, poorly communicated timetable changes, too long gaps between peak hour services, &quot;abysmal&quot; weekend services.\n \nThey said shift and emergency workers were struggling to reach their workplaces due to cancelled services.\n \n \n&quot;We ask for a detailed response to each concern raised and assurances that these concerns are being addressed as a matter of urgency,&quot; they wrote.\n \n&quot;In the spirit of collaboration, we have each worth with GTR to share users' concerns and we have communicated your assurances to commuters that things are improving.\n \n&quot;The anecdotal evidence that we are receiving suggests that commuters are still experiencing service levels well below 'emergency' expectations.&quot;\n \nThe MPs questioned why possible tweaks to timetables run by other train operators had not been down.\n \nThey also claimed passengers were still &quot;in the dark&quot; about the compensation offer made to them by Great Northern. They requested that enhanced compensation should be made available to affected passengers.\n \n&quot;Passengers are fed up of hearing that 'things are going to improved',&quot; the wrote.\n \n&quot;Five weeks of emergency planning has not stabilised the service sufficiently to restore our confidence in GTR as an operator.&quot;\n \n \n \n ",

And wouldn't it be lovely if we still had them\n \nDespite rumours that the pier is to turn into a nightclub, the sisters are certain this will not happen.\n \nJoanne, 37, who was formerly an officer for Merseyside police, said: “We will not become a nightclub.\n \n“Evening events will be taking place around once every three months, and they will be well planned and all attendees must have tickets purchased in advance, and there will be high security.\n \n“We are a coffee shop and bar, it wouldn’t be possible to turn the venue into a club every night, it takes too much work.\n \n \n \n \n“Our main focus always is, and always will be, the day time.”\n \n \n \nThe Jamieson family have had the lease of the Southport Pier Cafe for 10 years, opening in 2008.\n \nNatalie, 31, said: “We care about the pier, it isn’t just a job - this is our life.\n \n“We have a contact here for 20 years, why would we do anything that could damage our own future and the pier?\n \n“Many people have suggested we should be open late during the summer, and we have listened to that and we are trying to make the relevant changes.\n \n“We want the people of Southport to come down and support the pier and our local business.”\n \nTeen's terror at being threatened with 'hunting knife' during scrambler bike robbery\n \nIt is hoped that the changes that the sisters and Sefton Council are trying to make will appeal to people of all ages - and will make the pier a destination for all local residents, and tourists, to enjoy.\n \nTens of thousands of people take a walk in Southport’s pier each year, and Natalie and Joanne think their plans mean it will only get busier.\n \nIn the licensing application, the sisters have sought permission for outside the venue as well, to enable them to host pop-up stalls and events in the summer.\n \nThe new plans are set to create at least 20 jobs and increase footfall at one of Southport’s most famous attractions.\n \nNatalie, who formerly ran the Town Gardens Cafe in Lord Street, said: “We want to make the pier more of a destination for visitors, encouraging people to attend and therefore having a knock-on effect for our town, bringing trade to hotels and restaurants.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n“We just want to say that everything we are proposing to do has been discussed with Sefton Council tourism and they are fully behind our plans.\n \n“They have been really supportive over the past year whilst we were planning.”\n \nThese plans are just part of the huge refurbishment set to take place, as Sefton Council secured &pound;2m from the Coastal Community Fund in order to undertake the extensive works to the pier.\n \nThe overall project will deliver more than &pound;2.9m of improvements creating additional jobs, increasing visitor numbers and securing Southport Pier as a valued asset for many years to come.\n \nGunman explains why he shot man in head in front of Christmas shoppers\n \nThe refurbishment of the pier structure is being carried out in two stages – the first phase took place in December and the second phase began in March, with the project due to finish in December this year.\n \nAs part of the works, there is set to be a new access point to the pier constructed and a slide attraction from going from the pier to the beach.\n \nCllr Marion Atkinson, Sefton Council’s Labour cabinet member for regeneration and skills, said: “We are delighted the works on Southport Pier have started, which will truly transform the attraction.\n \n“The works will see major improvements that will improve access and add new uses, while enhancing and protecting the pier for years to come.\n \n“We firmly believe the money being invested will continue to be a critical element in Sefton’s visitor economy.”",

They will obviously move as quick as they can to get resources here.&quot;\n \nFire on Saddleworth moors that can be seen for miles \nHe said transporting two of the high volume pumps to remote locations would give his crews an &quot;excellent quantity of water with a nice main across a big area that we can tap into&quot;.\n \nMr Keelan said firefighters were working &quot;extremely hard in really hot conditions&quot; but morale was high as he said: &quot;It's more of a task to get them down here to rest.&quot;\n \nFirefighters on a total of 29 fire engines from Greater Manchester and neighbouring fire and rescue services used beaters and specialist wildfire equipment to tackle the flames.\n \n \nIn addition, Greater Manchester Police deployed a helicopter to assess the scene and United Utilities provided a helicopter that can be used to drop water onto remote areas.\n \nThe blaze, on the edge of Saddleworth Moor, started on Sunday and was brought under control but it reignited the next day and has continued in one of the worst moorland fires to hit the region.\n \nThe impact of the blaze could even be seen from space as Nasa satellites picked up the plumes of smoke.\n \n \n \nspace tweet \n \n \nAmong the affected areas was the village of Carrbrook, in Stalybridge, where 34 households in the Calico Crescent area were evacuated on Tuesday night when strong winds pushed flames near to their properties.\n \nHouseholders were allowed to return home on Wednesday following air quality assessments.\n \nAir quality levels in the area are being monitored regularly in different locations with people in affected areas urged to follow advice from Public Health England and keep their windows and doors closed.\n \n \n \nplane tweet \n \n \nExperts warned that high levels of pollutants generated from the blaze could have a significant effect on people's health.\n \nHugh Coe, professor of atmospheric composition at the University of Manchester, said plume peak concentrations were &quot;very high&quot; and air quality close to the fire was &quot;very poor&quot;.\n \nHe said pollution plumes have been detected in the centre of Manchester.\n \nFour local schools decided to close on Wednesday for the safety of their pupils.\n \nThe cause of the original seat of the fire - thought to be at Buckton Hill, which is land above Buckton Vale, Carrbrook - has not been established but fire chiefs said a detailed investigation would be launched at the appropriate time.\n \nOne possible line of inquiry could focus on the frequent gathering of off-road bikers - many not displaying registered plates - at a nearby large quarry.",

			"body": " Last time Westminster City Council tried to take on Berwick Street markets, Joanna Lumley got involved and one cheese seller wrote to the Queen. \n \nStreet traders have warned it will have another fight on its hands, if it pushes ahead with its proposal to increase charges at some of central London's oldest running street and farmers' markets.\n \nThe council says the eight markets in the borough are costing too much to run - with street cleansing, waste management and administration saddling it with losses of up to &pound;300,000 a year.\n \nIt is floating the idea to pass on those costs directly to local market traders.\n \nWhat's happening in west London \nBut that idea has not gone down well on Soho's streets.\n \nSome Berwick traders run family stalls that have sold treats and wares in the key cultural district for generations.\n \nThey won a battle to save the market from the council's plans to hand it to a private operator last year.\n \nWestminster backed down after the petition to save Berwick Street was signed by more than 37,000 people, including Stephen Fry and Joanna Lumley.\n \nFlower trader Laecia Stannett has been selling blooms there since she was a little girl helping out on her dad's stall. She runs Ronnie's Flowers with her brother now.\n \n \nShe said she believes the council is trying to &quot;gentrify&quot; the markets, and did not support the charges going up - questioning what services the council would offer in exchange for more fees.\n \n&quot;Really and truly they didn't really want us here, I don't think,&quot; she said. &quot;They've been trying to get rid of us for years. They always give you bigger hurdles, but we've stuck it out and we ain't going nowhere.&quot;\n \nBerwick Street is one of the capital's oldest surviving markets, believed to have its roots in the 18th century.\n \n Tower Bridge peanut vendors face legal crackdown \n \nIt it said to have been the first to sell grapefruit in London, and in Soho's Bohemian heyday, author Virgina Woolf used to buy her nylons there.\n \nToday, it is a largely &quot;foodie&quot; destination, but has &quot;seen better days,&quot; Soho Dairy owner Robin Smith said.\n \nIt cost him about &pound;25,000 to set up his stall in 2015. He has had to fight to keep his stall selling artisanal cheeses, milk and eggs to high-end restaurants and cafes, and market visitors.\n \n \nJust months after he set up, the council moved to axe his licence as it readied to transfer the market to a private operator.\n \nIn response, Mr Smith and other traders launched the Berwick Street Traders Society, which was ultimately supported by the star-backed petition.\n \nDuring the battle, Mr Smith said he even wrote to the Queen hoping for records to prove the folklore claiming the markets may have been royally chartered by King James II in the 17th century.\n \nThe traders planned to tell the council the city's legislation would require it to provide additional services if it increased costs, Mr Smith said.\n \nBut higher charges are just one hurdle the markets face.\n \nScaffolding backdrops the markets, where local traders say demolitions and the noise of works on luxury retail space developing around their perimeter has drastically affected footfall.\n \n Fear discrimination at London nightclubs is widespread after claim black women charged more for entry \n \nMr Smith said if the council put up the charges, traders might consider paying up; but only if they were promised it would be invested in better markets.\n \n&quot;To put our charges up here they have to have a load of facilities; like we could do with some hygienic new toilet units, we could do with parking, we could do with loading bays, we could do with storage.&quot;\n \nMr Smith said many traders still depended on markets, choosing to sell on the streets rather than take on Soho's skyrocketing retail rents.\n \nHe said Berwick Street should be supported to become a producers' market.\n \n&quot;We serve a square mile of chefs and restaurants. So this could be the best produce street in the world, bar none. We have amazing chefs willing to pay sustainable prices for really good, small volume, quality food produce. That could be Berwick Street.&quot;\n \n \n So, what could change? \n \nThe changes could affect Berwick Street, Church Street, Rupert Street, Strutton Ground, Tachbrook Street, Maida Hill Place market, as well as two weekly farmers' markets at Marylebone and Pimlico.\n \nAmong the council's proposals, is that local traders could take on more of the costs for cleansing, waste collection, and administration fees through its street market licensing regime, with lower fees paid by local residents and &quot;start up&quot; traders.\n \nPresently, the council charges traders licensing fees of &pound;10.61 daily between Monday to Thursday, &pound;18.16 on Fridays, and &pound;24.40 on Saturdays, which have been unchanged since 2006.\n \n Oxford Street pedestrianisation could create a 'problem with beggars' claims Conservative candidate \n \nIt is not yet known what price-tag the changes could bring.\n \nIn unveiling the review, Councillor David Harvey said Westminster's markets had to &quot;continue to hold their own with other markets, on-line retailers and other attractions and provide what local residents want.&quot;\n \n&quot;I want to discuss with local residents and traders on each market how we can work together to make sure they continue to thrive and serve their neighbourhoods.”",

			"body": "AN attempt by a Fermanagh Sinn Féin councillor to change party policy on abortion was “unanimously defeated” at a meeting last Saturday.\nSheamus Greene who has previously criticised what he says is “abortion on demand” after the Republic of Ireland voted to reform its strict abortion laws backed a motion at Sinn Fein’s Ard Fheis requesting a conscience vote on the issue.\n“I have always supported the party [Sinn Féin] but in this particular case it’s not a view you can change because your party says so,” he told this newspaper earlier this month.\nCouncillor Greene said then he had no concerns about speaking out against party policy, pointing out that not all members are in agreement.\nAfter the motion by The Fergal O’Hanlon Cumann in Brookeborough was “unanimously defeated” according to a Sinn Féin spokeswoman, Councillor Greene issued a statement pledging to change the policy “from within.”\n“Sinn Féin policy has changed on the issue of abortion.\n“By tabling this motion we simply sought to accommodate the significant number of pro-life republicans who support the party and who are members.\n“Our motion failed on this occasion but I am confident that this will change in the future.\n“I have been a Sinn Féin supporter my entire life and will continue to be one. As we have seen, policies can and do change and I will endeavour to make this happen from within the party structures,” he told The Impartial Reporter.\nSinn Fein members, including Fermanagh-south Tyrone MLA Jemma Dolan, voted “decisively” to liberalise abortion law across Ireland.\nThe motion endorsed by delegates said the procedure should be provided through a GP-led service in a clinical context as determined by law and licensing practice for a limited gestational period.\nNo exact period was fixed to allow for future changes in medical advice; debate surrounds when a baby is potentially viable outside the womb.\nThe party also decided terminations should be available where a woman’s life, physical or mental health was at risk and, in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, where an infant could not survive.\nMeanwhile Miss Dolan spoke on Irish Unity, telling delegates that partition remains “the fault line through the heart of Ireland.”\n“But like Fermanagh winning an Ulster title, a United Ireland has never been more achievable,” she said.\nShe called on political parties “who claim to support a united Ireland” to “take action and seize the moment.”\nSupport us in our call for a referendum on Irish Unity. There is a better future to be had for all of us, if we chose to build it, together.”\nSeán Lynch discussed a proposal by his party which looks at the feasibility of setting up a “state insurance body” that would deal with the spiralling costs of insurance premiums.\n“Whilst the lower rates would definitely be cause to look into this method of delivering insurance, it would also offer greater transparency around the whole process as motorists would know exactly what they are paying for which currently for me is a real issue in the insurance industry,” he said.\nSinn Fein MP Michelle Gildernew told delegates that across the world women’s rights are “under attack in the most vindictive of ways from rape and sexual assault, to female genital mutilation.”\n“Many women and children live with the daily reality of domestic violence. Last year alone saw 30,000 reported incidents of domestic violence in the North, and over 3,000 reported sexual offences or rapes.\n“That’s an average of 90 incidents per day while underreporting is still recognised as a huge problem.\n“The proliferation of violence against women is nothing short of a disgrace,” she said.\nIn addition, Colm Gildernew MLA spoke on carers and that their rights be placed on a statutory footing and the call for the Electoral Boundary Commission to revert to their initial 2016 proposal.\nHe also called on the Irish government to release the findings of the Crowley Report into the death of Aidan McAnespie in 1988.",

			"body": "A 21-year-old dad who died from a rare form of cancer fulfilled his dream of meeting hero Steven Gerrard - and now his family are planning a special send-off.\n \nDaniel McGrath, from Soham, had written a bucket list of things he would like to achieve before he died, including meeting the Liverpool and England legend.\n \nThe father-of-one was determined to live his last days to the full and leave his nine-month-old daughter Millie heartfelt video messages - but he simply ran out of time\n \nNow his own mum Angela, 44, who lives in Girton, is compiling a scrap book of her own to help little Millie remember her much missed dad.\n \nDaniel, who only married his wife Rebecca last August, was given just a year to live after Addenbrooke's doctors diagnosed him with an extremely rare stomach cancer in March.\n \nHe passed away on June 10 surrounded by his family.\n \n \nMum Angela said Daniel spent his last few days supported by the &quot;fantastic&quot; staff at the Arthur Rank Hospice.\n \nHer son was receiving pain relief every half an hour and died soon after a visit from his Great Aunt Pat.\n \n&quot;I think that was what he was waiting for,&quot; said Angela.\n \n&quot;He said 'I'm really scared' before he died. I said 'don't be scared, your nan will be waiting for you'.\n \n&quot;Everyone thinks I'm mad but his favourite song when he was little was Danny Boy, so I was singing that to him when he died.\n \n&quot;I don't know if it comforted him but it comforted me.\n \n&quot;I got to say what I needed to say to him and the hospice let me wash him and dress him.&quot;\n \n \nAngela admitted that the family, including Daniel's 15-year-old brother Kane and 24-year-old sister Lorna, are struggling to come to terms with their loss.\n \n&quot;His younger brother is finding it really hard,&quot; she said. &quot;He's doing his mock GCSEs this week and he's been quite upset about it.\n \n&quot;For me its been a bit of a struggle. I just threw myself into doing stuff rather than thinking about it.&quot;\n \n \nThe family had previously helped Daniel launch a crowdfunding campaign to help him complete a bucket list of dreams to achieve before he died.\n \nThese included meeting Steven Gerrard and going to a Liverpool match, riding a Harley Davidson, getting a new tattoo and going indoor skydiving.\n \nSadly the rapid decline in his health meant Daniel was not able to complete the full list, but he was overjoyed to go to Liverpool Football Club's home at Anfield and ride a Harley Davidson.\n \n \nPhotos shared by his mum show a grinning Daniel alongside Liverpool star Mo Salah and giving a thumbs up on the back of a motorbike.\n \nDuring the motorcycle experience in April, around 100 bikers turned up to show their support for Daniel.\n \n&quot;He got really emotional about it, said Angela, &quot;He said 'I didn't know this many people cared about me mum' and I said 'everybody loves you Daniel'.&quot;\n \n \nAngela said it still feels &quot;surreal&quot; to her that Daniel has gone, and she is reminded of him when she looks at his young daughter Millie.\n \n&quot;She looks exactly the same as Daniel when he was her age,&quot; she explained.\n \n&quot;Ive started doing a scrap book for Millie of Daniel, what he was like as a baby and writing little stories of what he was like.\n \n&quot;He loved her very much. He was so excited to become a dad. When she was born he was so proud. He just idolised her. It was just a joy to see them together.&quot;\n \n \nAhead of Daniel's funeral on June 28, his family have launched a fundraising webpage to raise money for Arthur Rank and say thank you for the care they provided.\n \nMembers of the Titan MCC motorcycle club will be meeting at the Wheatsheaf pub in Stow-Cum-Quy will be meeting at 11.30am to escort the Daniel to St Mary's Church in Burwell.\n \n \n \n \nAngela admitted that it will be a very challenging day for her, but holds on to the happy memories she has of her son.\n \n&quot;I will remember him with the cheeky little smile and going mum lets have a laugh,&quot; she said.\n \n&quot;That's the Daniel I'm going going to remember, who didn't let anything get him down who was always cheerful and happy and up for a laugh.&quot;\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

			"source": "smart-scrapy-bs",
			"body": "Two buses took nearly one hundred people from Stroud to a Brexit demonstration in London at the weekend - and the\ncame along for the ride.\nThe plan: depart Stratford Park at 8am on Saturday, June 23, arrive in London for noon, and then join protestors outside Parliament demanding a vote on the final Brexit deal.\nAnd what we wanted to find out: if the pro-EU activists got their way, how did they think Stroud would vote now, in contrast to the Remain result in 2016?\nThe activists we joined marched under the banner of Glostays, a Gloucestershire group formed in the wake of the Brexit result that campaigns for the UK to remain in the EU.\nOnce on the bus, we first spoke to Charlie and Eva - in their words a “mixed European couple.”\nCharlie is born and bred in Gloucestershire, while Eva is from Germany, having moved to the UK about twenty years ago.\nTheir concern about Brexit is, firstly, practical: what rights will Eva have in the UK after we leave?\nUncertainty about this straight after the Brexit vote meant they initially considered moving to the continent, but soon dropped the idea.\n“We have a lot of friends here, and we’d hate to have to start all over again, rebuilding the relationships we have,” they explained.\nAnd they were sceptical the Government’s proposed ‘settled status’ for EU nationals who arrived in the UK before March 2019 would give Eva just as many freedoms as before.\nSuch concern was echoed by Nadine and Phil, opposite Charlie and Eva on the bus.\nNadine is also from Germany, having moved to Stroud when she was young, while Phil’s father is Swedish.\nThey said their biggest fear was being unable to easily visit Nadine’s elderly parents back home.\nThey also said such anxiety was felt throughout Stroud’s European community, some of which, suggested Phil, had been first drawn to the area by its Steiner schools.\nBut Charlie and Eva stressed that, for them at least, their concern was not just about the practicalities of living together in a post-Brexit Britain.\n“We fear Brexit means there’s no room for a progressive future in the UK,” explained Eva.\nLikewise, Charlie was quick to decry seeing the UK embark on a “race to the bottom” after Brexit, and he expected tax and spending cuts. Nadine and Phil later carried a banner at the march that read ‘Brexit = Austerity’.\nAs they explained this on the bus, their concern soon gave way to frustration. Since the referendum there had been no conversation about what to do to solve the concerns of those who voted Leave, they argued.\nBut not all protesters predicted post-Brexit doom. For Rob from Gloucester, whose mum had often visited a European town twinned with Tewkesbury, he said he simply felt European and so would just miss being part of the EU.\nWhat did the protestors make of suggestions from some\nreaders that, in calling for another vote, they were protesting against democracy?\nAt the same time as the demonstration in London, pro-Brexit campaigners were marching in Gloucester calling for the Prime Minister to respect the original Brexit vote and to stop “dilly dallying”\nBut those on the Brexit bus, like Antony from Nailsworth, were unphased.\nWhen we put the question to him, he argued: “We’re doing the opposite - our protest is a manifestation of democracy.\n“Democracy is not static and people are allowed to change their minds.”\nHe also denied second vote would re-open the country’s wounds from the fight over the first - “the wounds haven’t healed anyway,” he replied.\nOthers, like Pauline from Tetbury, took a different line, arguing the original referendum result was based on “lies”, which made it illegitimate.\nPauline was similar to many on the bus, in that either the march was their first protest, or the first for a while - the last time Pauline was at a demo was in the 1980s for a Free Nelson Mandela protest.\nBut though she had not been particularly active in the 2016 campaign, seeing consequences from Brexit already in her work - her job means she spends time with universities who, she claims, are already losing funding - has energised to get out and campaign on the EU for the first time.\n“Beware the angry middle-aged woman,” she warned us.\nSimilarly, Graham, an elderly Liberal Democrat from Stroud who carried the Glostays banner part way through the streets of London, had never been to a protest before.\nBut, being old enough to have been born before World War Two, he said he had been motivated to march to keep his grandchildren safe, arguing that Europe needed to “stick together” for the sake of peace.\nBy and large, protestors from Glostays were on the older rather than younger side, though there were a few exceptions.\nTake Tizzy from Rodborough: she had had been too young to vote in 2016 but now, having recently turned 18, she wanted a second vote to cast a first ballot on Brexit.\nSo, why did protesters think Stroud voted Remain in 2016, and did they think the district would do so again?\nWhen we put this to Gill Lloyd, who chairs Glostays, he praised the campaign led by Neil Carmichael, Stroud’s pro-EU Conservative MP at the time of the referendum.\nAnd, once we got to London, it turned out Mr Carmichael was actually at the march.\n“I tried to lead from the front during the referendum, and never shied away from praising Europe - to some extent I think that made a difference,” he later told the\n.\nOthers, like Gareth from Stroud, argued it was less about the campaign and more about the district's ethos.\n\"The general attitude of Stroud people is that we're inclusive - just look at the welcome we've given to Syrian refugees.\"\nAll of the Glostays activists we spoke to, however, were confident Stroud would opt for Remain, or an option close to that, in a second vote.\nWhat do you think? Should there be another vote? Would Stroud vote Remain again? Email your thoughts to alex.clark@newsquest.co.uk",

			"body": "These are the first pictures of a cowardly drug dealer who blasted a rival with a shotgun in front of terrified Christmas shoppers.\n \nJamie Bridge fired at Christopher Jopson with a sawn-off shotgun in Southport town centre at lunchtime on December 21 last year.\n \n The 22-year-old, of Wyresdale Road, Aintree, also hit bus driver Lee Armstrong , as parents and children watched on in disbelief. \n \nBridge was released from a two-year jail sentence for dealing heroin and cocaine and possessing a blade in public, in February 2017.\n \nIn pictures uploaded to Facebook in 2016, he is seen surrounded by posters of nude women on the walls and stacks of toiletries in a narrow room with two bunk beds.\n \n Drug dealer who shot rival in head is guilty of attempted murder in town centre \n \n \n \nIn another image, Bridge, wearing a Nike Air Max t-shirt, is seen raising his middle finger in between two small bunk beds and a wall covered with drawings of scrambler bikes.\n \nHis victim Jopson, had 30 pellets removed from the back of his head, while Mr Armstrong, 32, suffered wounds to his head and left shoulder.\n \nBridge admitted wounding Jopson, 26, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, but denied attempted murder in a three-day trial.\n \n \n \nHe also admitted wounding Mr Armstrong, plus possessing a firearm with intent to both endanger life and to cause fear of violence.\n \nBridge claimed he only wanted &quot;to put him in hospital&quot; after Jopson threatened him with guns and robbed and stabbed his underling.\n \nBut a jury found the dad-of-one guilty by a majority of 10 to 2 this afternoon, after three hours of deliberation at Liverpool Crown Court.\n \nCCTV footage showed the masked gunman chase and fire at Jopson, in the middle of the road in Eastbank Street, at around 12.27pm.\n \nArriva worker Mr Armstrong had just waved 15 people onto a bus when he heard &quot;a loud bang and cracking noise&quot; and suddenly felt pain.\n \n \n \nThe victim said: &quot;I touched my head and realised I was bleeding. There were loads of people on the pavement all standing frozen.&quot;\n \nHenry Riding, prosecuting, said the pellets shattered the glass in a bus stop outside a Coral bookmakers, as Jopson &quot;fled for his life&quot;.\n \nGunman who shot man in head in front of shoppers denies attempted murder \nA schoolgirl witness told the jury the gunman pointed the weapon at Jopson's upper back, while her friend said he shouted &quot;get here&quot;.\n \nMicheal Gibbons, who pushed his &quot;terrified&quot; four-year-old son out of harm's way, said he saw the gunman stop, take aim and fire.\n \nHe said: &quot;In my opinion the shooter was aiming to hit the first male at close range and he didn’t care who else was around.&quot;\n \nMr Riding said: “Chasing after a man - no doubt fleeing for his life - and blasting him in the back of the head from a distance of no less than 10 metres is about as good as evidence as you can get of intention to kill.&quot;\n \nHe suggested Bridge - who police identified on earlier clips that day when he wasn't disguised - then hid at his girlfriend Julia Minicka's flat.\n \nWhen arrested in January, he denied any involvement, then repeated his lies in a second interview, after CCTV evidence was recovered.\n \n \nOfficers called to the scene found Jopson sitting on a chair, outside Thorntons in Chapel Street, holding a tea towel to his head.\n \nPC Michael Tague said he was &quot;quite dismissive&quot; when offered first aid, &quot;surprisingly relaxed&quot; and &quot;didn’t appear to be shaken at all&quot;.\n \nJopson initially refused to give a statement, but told police he was shot by a man nicknamed &quot;Wolfie&quot;, who had a Polish girlfriend, Julia.\n \nHe said he could not think of any reason why &quot;Wolfie&quot; would want to shoot him, telling officers: &quot;I don’t have any issues with anyone.&quot;\n \nBridge said he and Jopson both dealt cannabis but Jopson was &quot;jealous&quot; of his profits and threatened him, Miss Minicka and his mum.\n \nBridge said: “He said if I didn't stop selling drugs in the Southport area he will blow her head off.”\n \nHe said he heard Jopson &quot;cocking&quot; a gun on the phone and he came to Miss Minicka's flat with other men, asked for him and kicked the door.\n \nBridge said Jopson worked with dealers who previously forced him to sell Class A drugs and who he fell out with when jailed.\n \nHe said he and Miss Minicka moved into the town's Vincent Hotel on December 19 and 20, after a friend, Simon Dunn, was stabbed.\n \nBridge said Dunn's phone rang him at 1.15am on December 15, but it was Jopson, who said &quot;you’re not out tonight are you?&quot; and hung up.\n \nHe said he found out Jopson stabbed Dunn and because of his &quot;anger&quot;, got a gun off a friend on December 21, “just to hurt him”.\n \nBridge said he had it for &quot;protection&quot;, adding: &quot;It was either going to be me dead or... It was either going to go one way or the other.”\n \nHe claimed he tried to get close to Jopson “so I didn’t injure no-one else around him”, then &quot;aimed at his leg&quot;.\n \n \nAsked about injuring Mr Armstrong, he said: &quot;I feel sorry for him and his family. I regret it every day of me life.&quot;\n \nBridge accepted telling &quot;a pack of lies&quot; to police and swearing on his son’s life when denying being involved.\n \nCharles Lander, defending, asked: &quot;Did you intend to kill Mr Jopson that day?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; he replied.\n \nMr Riding asked what he meant by “it was either going to me dead or...&quot; and it going &quot;one way or the other”.\n \nBridge said he meant injured - not dead - and denied having a &quot;shoot to kill policy&quot;.\n \n Attempted murder accused 'chased victim down street and fired shotgun at his head in front of Christmas shoppers' \n \nHe said: &quot;If I wanted to kill him I would have got up close to him and done it properly.”\n \nBridge, who claimed Jopson tried to chat up Miss Minicka, said he didn't want to kill him and spend his life in prison.\n \nBut he accepted if Jopson chased him and fired at him with a shotgun, he would think he was trying to kill him.\n \nHe agreed he had &quot;ready access&quot; to the weapon and &quot;the bottle&quot; to shoot someone, but said he did not aim at Jopson's head.\n \nBridge, who confessed to destroying his mobile phone, said: “I fired it as I was running... I aimed for the bottom half of his body.”\n \nHe said Jopson was &quot;the one who caused all this&quot; and the shooting was justified by his threats and stabbing Mr Dunn.\n \nBridge confirmed he offered to have the gun handed into police, in exchange for the attempted murder charge being dropped.\n \n \nThe dealer said: &quot;I’m sorry for the people I affected, but I’m not sorry for what I did to Jopson.”\n \nHe accepted Dunn was a &quot;smackhead&quot; who dealt cannabis for him and Jopson &quot;shivved&quot; and &quot;taxed&quot; him, taking &pound;400 meant for him.\n \nBridge denied it was “a drugs turf war over who controls Southport” but accepted it was “an escalating war between rival drug dealers”.\n \nHe said Jopson previously attacked Dunn with a hammer and he got a shotgun to &quot;teach him a lesson&quot;, wanting “to put him in hospital”.\n \nBridge said he collected the gun from Victoria Park, but it was a &quot;coincidence&quot; he saw Jopson in a Betfred bookmakers and wasn't tipped off.\n \nHe said Jopson ducked when he chased and shot at him, which is why he got him in the head, despite aiming for his leg.\n \nThe jury heard Merseyside Police received five reports in 2017 stating Jopson may have been in possession of a firearm.\n \nMr Lander said these allegations &quot;had not been investigated or substantiated by the police&quot;.\n \nA police log recorded Dunn received four puncture wounds when he was stabbed and reported &pound;400 in cash and a bicycle stolen.\n \nMr Lander said Jopson's previous convictions include four assaults, possessing a bladed article and affray.\n \nHe argued what his client did was &quot;appalling&quot; and &quot;disgraceful&quot;, but jurors could not be sure he intended to kill Jopson.\n \nHowever, Mr Riding said &quot;the town wasn't big enough for the both of them&quot; and &quot;Mr Bridge was ready to take this war to Mr Jopson”.\n \nHe said in a scene in the 1971 Dirty Harry film, Clint Eastwood's character, Inspector Callahan, is grilled over shooting an alleged rapist.\n \nMr Riding said Insp Callahan says &quot;when a naked man is chasing a woman through an alley with a butcher knife and a hard-on, I figure he isn’t out collecting for the Red Cross,&quot; to which the mayor replies: &quot;I think he’s got a point.&quot;\n \nMr Riding said: “Sometimes the evidence speaks for itself.”\n \nJudge Denis Watson, QC, said Bridge will be sentenced tomorrow and remanded him in custody.\n \n  ",

			"body": "THIS is the terrifying moment masked men brandishing an axe and a crowbar broke into a shop in Maguiresbridge in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\nThe men gained entry to Frazer’s One Stop Shop in the village where they knocked over some of the displays before leaving the ATM “in bits” and escaping without anything.\nFootage, seen by The Impartial Reporter, shows how the men, who were all wearing dark clothing, spent less than 10 minutes at the premises, owned by businessman Adrian Frazer.\nIt shows how the men arrived at the forecourt in a Subaru Outback at about 1.28am and quickly began to push the front door. Then they suddenly left the scene and four minutes later returned with one of the them taking an axe out of the vehicle and using it to gain entry.\nWhile inside the shop they ransacked shelves of magazines and pastries before attempting to remove the ATM. But they were unable to access it and left empty handed at 1.38am.\nSpeaking at the scene yesterday (Wednesday) Mr. Frazer, who has owned the shop for eight years, said the incident had caused “disruption to the customer and the staff.”\n“As a businessman you always have to worry and we will have to step up our security,” he said.\nManager Darren McManus, who was alerted to the break in as soon as it occurred, said he was “shocked.”\n“It is not something that happens too often in a small community like ours, you never expect that type of thing to go on in this area.\n“They didn’t take anything as far as we can see, they wrecked the front of the ATM, ransacked part of the shop and the ATM is in bits. They damaged the front of the door and damaged a few stands but that was about it.\n“We will now leave it with the police to investigate,” he said.\nPart of the shop was sealed off yesterday as detectives commenced their investigation.\nDetectives are appealing for information and witnesses following the report of the attempted theft.\nIn a statement, Detective Inspector Trevor Stevenson said: “We received a report at approximately 1.50am that three men had forced entry to a shop in the Main Street area, using an axe,” he said.\n“Damage was caused to an internal ATM machine. However, it was reported the men left empty handed.”\nDetective Stevenson said he is appealing to anyone who was in the area and saw any suspicious activity, or anyone who knows anything about this incident, to contact police at Enniskillen on number 101 quoting reference 112 of 20/061/18.",

			"body": "Areas across Cardiff will be targeted in a 'blitz' of deep cleaning this summer.\n \nA council team will be in wards across the city digging out silt and debris from between the pavement and the roads, clearing gullies and drains, litter picking, cutting back overgrowth in lanes as well as any other work that is required in what's known as 'blitz' operations.\n \nCommunity litter picks have also been organised as part of the council's Love Where You Live Campaign - which aims to promote civic pride and that littering and fly-tipping isn’t acceptable.\n \n Where will the deep cleans be happening? \n \nThe council's deep-cleaning 'blitz' operations are taking place in parts of Pontprennau and Pentwyn this week, before moving to parts of Cathays and Plasnewydd on July 2 until July 6.\n \nAreas of the following wards will then receive deep clean this summer:\n \n \n July 9 – July 13: Ely and Fairwater \n July 16– July 20: Caerau and Canton \n July 23 – July 27: Butetown and Grangetown \n July 30 – August 24: Cardiff’s parks. \n \n Where and when will the litter picks be? \n \nCommunity litter picks have been organised from between 10am and 11.30am at the following locations:\n \n \n June 29: Countisbury Avenue, Llanrumney \n July 2: Cathays Library, Cathays \n July 4: Albany Primary School, Plasnewydd \n July 9: Fairwater Leisure Centre, Fairwater \n July 13: Ely &amp; Caerau Hub, Ely \n July 18: Jubilee Recreation Ground, Canton \n July 20: Roundwood, Pentwyn \n July 23: Canal Park, Butetown \n July 25: The Marl, Butetown \n July 26: Eastern Leisure Centre, Llanrumney \n July 27: Fairwater Green, Fairwater \n \nCouncillor Michael Michael, Cardiff council's cabinet member for clean streets and recycling, said: &quot;The uptake from the community with this campaign has been superb and we now have 13 community groups set up across the city. They all do an excellent job supporting the council to try to keep communities clean and tidy and I would like to thank them all for their efforts.\n \n“We need to create a sense of pride in our communities, so that people understand that throwing litter on the floor or fly tipping in back lanes isn’t acceptable. Initially the campaign focussed on the inner more densely populated areas, where this work is most needed but I am pleased to report that all wards across the city will now receive this service.&quot;\n \nThe council has recently announced it will use infrared cameras and spot fines of &pound;400 in its battle against fly tippers.\n \nA survey asking for their views on fly tipping has also been launched.",

			"body": "A heterosexual couple fighting a law which prevents them entering into a civil partnership have called on the Government to &quot;act with urgency&quot; after winning a legal battle at the UK's highest court.\n \nFollowing a declaration by the Supreme Court that the current legislation is &quot;incompatible&quot; with human rights laws, Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan described being &quot;elated&quot;.\n \nSpeaking outside court after Wednesday's ruling, Ms Steinfeld, 37, said: &quot;Today we are a step closer to opening civil partnerships to all, a measure that would be fair, popular and good for families and children across the country.&quot;\n \nMr Keidan, 41, said there was now only one option - &quot;to extend civil partnerships to all&quot;.\n \nHe said it was hoped the Government would now &quot;act with urgency&quot; for the sake of thousands of couples across the country.\n \nThe couple, who have two young daughters and live in Hammersmith, west London, are currently prevented from having a legal union through the route of civil partnership because the Civil Partnership Act 2004 says only same-sex couples are eligible.\n \nWhat happened? \n \nFive Supreme Court justices, including the court's president Lady Hale, granted a declaration that, in precluding a different sex couple from entering into a civil partnership, the Act was &quot;incompatible&quot; with European human rights laws on discrimination and the right to a private and family life.\n \nWhile granting the declaration, the court pointed out that the Government was not &quot;obliged&quot; to do anything as the result of its decision on incompatibility.\n \nLord Kerr, explaining the decision, said the Government &quot;does not seek to justify the difference in treatment between same-sex and different sex couples&quot;.\n \nHe added: &quot;To the contrary, it accepts that the difference cannot be justified.&quot;\n \nWhat the Government sought was &quot;tolerance of the discrimination while it sorts out how to deal with it&quot;.\n \nHe concluded: &quot;That cannot be characterised as a legitimate aim.&quot;\n \nWhat is a civil partnership? \nA civil partnership, which was created by the Civil Partnership Act 2004, defined civil partnerships as a ‘relationship between two people of the same sex’.\n \nHowever, at this morning’s hearing, the court said the act is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, because it does not apply to heterosexual couples.\n \nSo can heterosexual couples now enter into a civil partnership? \n  Not yet. \n \nThat would require an act of Parliament, but the ruling certainly puts pressure on the government to extend the right to civil partnerships to all.\n \n Firefighters call in army to tackle raging Saddleworth Moor fire \n \nWhat is the difference between civil partnership and marriage? \n  There are some small differences relating to the ceremonies; a civil partnership becomes official when the second civil partner signs a particular legal document, while marriages aren’t recognised by law until the couple say their vows. \n \nAlso, civil partnership ceremonies aren’t religious and can’t be treated as such.\n \n  Civil partnerships can’t be ended on the grounds of adultery (at present, given that civil partnership is only available to same sex couples and the definition of adultery specifies that it takes place between a man and a woman). \n \nMarriages, however, can.\n \n  Those in civil partnerships should also be aware that, when travelling or living abroad, the union is often not legally recognised in the same way that marriage is. \n \n  However, the legal rights of those involved are actually exactly the same in many areas, such as child maintenance, tenancy rights, social security, inheritance tax, full life insurance recognition, next of kin rights, and acquiring parental responsibility. \n \nWhat did Rebecca and Charles argue? \nRebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan successfully argued that the introduction of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 meant that gay couples could choose one of two ways to have their relationship recognised in English law, while heterosexual couples could only marry.\n \nThat inequality, according to the Supreme Court, amounted to discrimination.\n \nHow did Lord Kerr react? \n \nLord Kerr said it was &quot;salutary to recall that a declaration of incompatibility does not oblige the Government or Parliament to do anything&quot;.\n \nDuring a hearing in May, the couple's barrister, Karon Monaghan QC, told the Supreme Court that they have &quot;deep-rooted and genuine ideological objections to marriage&quot; and are &quot;not alone&quot; in their views.\n \nShe said matrimony was &quot;historically heteronormative and patriarchal&quot; and the couple's objections were &quot;not frivolous&quot;.\n \nMs Monaghan added: &quot;These are important issues, no small matters, and they are serious for my clients because they cannot marry conformable with their conscience and that should weigh very heavily indeed.&quot;\n \nThe Supreme Court justices unanimously allowed an appeal by the couple against a Court of Appeal decision which went against them in February last year.\n \nThe Court of Appeal had agreed that they had established a potential violation of Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which relates to discrimination, taken with Article 8, which refers to respect for private and family life.\n \nBut, by a majority of two to one, the judges said the interference was justified by the Government's policy of &quot;wait and evaluate&quot;.\n \nThe Government said it was decided, after public consultations and debate in Parliament, not to extend civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples, abolish them or phase them out at that stage.\n \nThe aim was to see how extending marriage to same-sex couples impacted on civil partnerships before making a final decision which, if reversed in a few years, would be disruptive, unnecessary and extremely expensive.\n \nMr Keidan, a magazine editor, said outside court: &quot;There are 3.3 million cohabiting couples in this country, the fastest growing family type.\n \n&quot;Many want legal recognition and financial protection, but cannot have it because they are not married and because the choice of a civil partnership is not open to them.\n \n&quot;The law needs to catch up with the reality of family life in Britain in 2018.&quot;",

			"body": "TWO sisters who may be the oldest surviving twins from Yorkshire were overjoyed to be reunited on their 95th birthday. Muriel Stancliffe and twin sister Lily Poolman met for the first time in more than three years tonight (Weds June 27) before a party with family and friends at the Devon pub in Crossgates, Leeds,. The twin sisters, who grew up in East End Park, Leeds, were inseparable as children and young adults and trained as hairdressers together at Woodhouse Lane College. They both joined the Women’s Land Army as 19-year-olds during the Second World War in 1942. It was the only way the two sisters could help the war effort and stay together after Women’s Land Army bosses agreed not to split them up. They worked on farms in Wiltshire for four years before working together as hairdressers in Leeds. Lily, who has six great-great grandchildren, met her late husband Reg in Wiltshire and the couple later ran a farm in Swindon area, while Muriel stayed in Leeds. Muriel, whose husband Joseph died aged 52 in 1973, has three great-grandchildren. Muriel said she felt stomach pains and could not sleep when Lily was giving birth to her first child Carol, now aged 71. Muriel, who later worked as a sales assistant at Woolworths in Crossgates, said after the party: “It was lovely to see her again, we were delighted.” Lily said: “I was thrilled to see her – I just wanted to hug her.” Muriel’s granddaughter Jane Stancliffe, 37, said: “They are very close. They used to spend a lot of time together and still speak to each other all the time. “Grandma used to travel to Swindon a lot but she has been unable to travel more recently due to mobility issues.” Jane said the sisters’ mother Ethel lived to 104, adding: “They are up there with the oldest surviving twins in the UK.",

			"body": "Winner of The Herald’s Sports Personality of the Year prize, Heather, 27, who was raised in Plymouth and honed her cricketing skills in Plymstock, was honoured for services to cricket after leading England to beat India in the final to win the 2017 World Cup and helping change women’s cricket forever. Her 364 runs at an average of 45, including a century against Pakistan, were central to England’s success. After collecting her award from the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace, she said: “For us to sell out Lord’s was something I never thought would happen and something like 200 million people watched us on telly which was completely unheard of. “There was a moment when we were singing the national anthem in that world cup final when the whole crowd was with us and Eileen Whelan (former English Test cricketer) who was 105 years old was ringing the five-minute bell. “There was Rachael Heyhoe Flint (the former England women’s cricket captain) who obviously fought for us to play at Lord’s, I was getting quite emotional and thinking what a big day it was for the sport and the women who played before us. “To be allowed to play at Lord’s, to sell it out and to win on home soil was the perfect story really.” Knight, who plays club cricket for Plymstock in the Devon Cricket League, was among Wisden’s Cricketers of the Year. Of her visit to Buckingham Palace for the glittery honours ceremony, she said: “It is a bit strange putting the heels on. We do not often get the heels out on tours in cricket. “It is nice to get outside the cricket bubble and have a day off.” She said it was also great to be able to share the day with her father Mike, mother Beccy and brother Stephen because “it is also an award for them for all the support they have given me and the trials and tribulations I have put them through”. Also collecting an honour at the palace yesterday was Bee Gee Barry Gibb, who was made a Knight by the Prince of Wales, and chef Rick Stein, who was made a CBE",

			"body": "The weather is set to be scorching this week, with highs reaching more than 33&deg;C, in some parts of the country.\n \nThis is the third heatwave we've seen this year, and experts are predicting it'll last a lot longer than the others.\n \nMeteorologist Amy Hodgson, of The Weather Channel, said: “It is looking like we’re going to get some lovely hot and sunny weather.\n \n“There is now high confidence that temperatures will increase to above to well above normal through next week.\n \n“Sunny, dry and very warm conditions are expected across much of Europe, under high pressure that will be centred across the British Isles on Monday, with temperatures reaching the high 20s across England.”\n \n \nBut sadly, bees, wasps, midges - we're seeing plenty of those around at the moment and they can make it tricky just to sit outside - never mind dining al fresco or having a barbecue.\n \nAnd one insect you don't want to get bitten by is the horsefly.\n \n According to Chronicle Live, the Northumberland Wildlife Trust says you’ll find horseflies between May and September - which means we're right at the peak of horsefly season. \n \nSo, what are horseflies, why do they bite and what should you do if you get bitten? We take a look.\n \nWhat are horseflies and where do you find them? \nHorseflies, also commonly known as clegs, have razor sharp jaws and can inflict a very painful bite.\n \nThey are large, dark-coloured flies measuring between 1cm to 2.5cm. As their name suggests, they like to feed off horses, so you’ll find clusters of them near stables and grazing fields. Cows are another favourite source of blood for horseflies, although any large mammal will do them - including humans and dogs.\n \nYou’ll also find horse flies around water pools, woodlands, meadows and grassy fields. Anywhere it's nice to spend a sunny day, really.\n \nWhy do they bite? \nThe female flies need to feed off blood so they can produce eggs. Their jagged teeth slice open skin, while the flies also release an anti-coagulant to stop the blood from clotting while they eat.\n \nThe male flies feed off nectar.\n \nHow do I know If I've been bitten by a horsefly? \n \n According to NHS Choices, a bite from a horsefly can be very painful and the bitten area of skin will usually be red and raised. \n \nYou may also experience:\n \n \n a larger red, raised rash (called hives or urticaria) \n dizziness \n weakness \n wheezing \n part of your body becoming puffy and swollen \n \n Firefighters call in army to tackle raging Saddleworth Moor fire \n \nHorsefly bites can take a while to heal and can become infected. This is because, unlike midge bites, they cut into the skin rather than pierce it - which can cause the wound to become infected.\n \nWhat should I do if I get bitten? \nKeep the wound clean with antiseptic soap and warm water to avoid it becoming infected. Other than that, you won't usually have to do anything.\n \nHowever, if you do show symptoms of an infection, such as such as pus or increasing pain, redness and swelling, then contact your GP.\n \n This quiz will reveal whether you've got a sleep problem \n \nIn rare cases, some people suffer allergic reactions. Symptoms include dizziness, wheezing, difficulty breathing, a blotchy skin rash and severe swelling that may be visible in your lips or tongue. If this happens to you, seek immediate medical help.\n \nAnd avoid scratching the bite. It won't stop the itching and can increase the likelihood of an infection.",

In addition £100 has been given to Beccles Public Hall – money which will go towards redecorating its long corridor. Maureen Alexander, a Marie Curie volunteer who received its cheque, and Mr Went, who is a member of the theatre group, said they were grateful for the group’s generous support. Bungay Theatre Group’s next show will be at Bungay Community centre on November 10 - an evening to commemorate the centenary of the end of the first world war.",

I’m hearing it involves items out in the open.&quot;\n \nA spokesman for Pontins earlier declined to comment, saying they were only interested in dealing with the fire at this point.\n \nFirefighters were still at the scene at around 6.40pm and, by around 7.30pm, one crew remained to damp down the blaze.

			"body": "They are calling on the Education Authority to preserve the Lurgan campus of Craigavon Senior High School, which is the only school in the UK that caters solely for GCSE students. Craigavon Senior High School was developed across two sites in Lurgan and Portadown as part of the pioneering Dickson Plan, which has offered a two-tier system of junior and senior high schools since the 1960s, effectively deferring selection to age 14. The senior school caters for 579 GCSE pupils, the majority of whom are on the Portadown site. The row began in 2016 when governors considered closing the Lurgan site after concerns were raised around health and safety, safeguarding and sustainability. They wanted to transport pupils by bus to the sister site in Portadown. But the proposal was dropped following a backlash by parents who insisted their children continue their education in Lurgan. Instead, they wanted the Education Authority to consider moving the children to temporary accommodation on the site of the junior school in Lurgan. Parents claim the school has deteriorated due to a lack of investment by education officials amid continued uncertainty over its future. They warn the current site is so \"unfit for purpose\" that children must \"eat their lunch between parked cars\" due to lack of outdoor space. Comparing children in the small school yard to \"caged animals at a zoo\", they have called for the immediate resignation of the schools' governors who they accused of failing the children. Community representative Norman Mawhinney said there was widespread concern about uncertainty over the school's future. He added: \"Our local sports clubs and politicians all agree with the need to keep these children in Lurgan. \"What we do not want is for them to continue to be educated in these awful conditions. People are prepared to fight for what they want for their children. We are stepping up our campaign by calling on governors to step aside.\" MLA Doug Beattie claimed the issues affecting the senior Lurgan campus had been \"obvious for 15 years\". He said: \"The Lurgan campus was only supposed to be a temporary solution years ago when the Dickson plan was rolled out. \"It does not have playing fields, the pupils have to eat their lunches between parked cars and there are safeguarding concerns around its proximity to the Southern Regional College. \"It is a sorry state of affairs. The problem is that instead of fixing the issues at the school, it has been allowed to run down.\" He added: \"Pupils cannot stay where they are because the school is not fit for purpose, but bussing them to Portadown is not the solution. \"Many of these children come from disadvantaged backgrounds and are the most vulnerable academically. \"There is a feeling that the Dickson Plan gives everything to the 60 per cent who are selected for grammar college and the rest are being neglected, it is truly awful.\" The principal of Craigavon Senior High School was unavailable for comment but an Education Authority spokesman said: “There is broad agreement across all stakeholders that short, medium and long-term action is required in relation to the Lurgan campus of Craigavon Senior High School. “We will continue to support the staff and governors of Craigavon Senior High School as they seek to continue to improve standards and care for the pupils on both campuses. \"Craigavon Senior High School is an important part of the Dickson Plan family of schools and will continue to receive the support it requires. “In the longer term, any proposal for change will be subject to a full consultation process and we will continue to engage with all relevant stakeholders.” Keep up-to-date with all the very latest news, what's on, sport and everything else in Belfast and beyond with the Belfast Live app.",

			"body": "A CLAIM that hosting the G8 in Fermanagh in 2013 would generate over £200 million for the area was “vastly exaggerated” when it fact it actually brought over £4 million to the local economy.\nThat’s the findings of a new report commissioned by Fermanagh and Omagh District Council which examines the 39th summit held at the Lough Erne Resort in Enniskillen five years ago this week.\nThe event was attended by world leaders, including the then Prime Minister David Cameron, the then U.S President Barack Obama, Russian President Vladimir Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nIn the 48 page document, devised by consultant Peter Quinn and costing £2,800, it is stated that the “media and political hype” surrounding the “vastly exaggerated estimates” of the potential benefit to the local and regional economies “proved to be just unrealistic.”\nSome of the estimates of the value of media coverage and of its capacity to increase the region’s potential for economic development or to provide exposure for both Fermanagh and Northern Ireland as attractive places to visit, or in which to invest or do business, have since turned out to have been “far too optimistic”, states the report.\nOne reason for the huge shortfall in the benefits received was that a major anticipated telecommunications legacy expected to derive from this event “did not materialise to anywhere approaching the anticipated extent.”\n“There were a variety of reasons and excuses for that, none of which was created locally; but by far the biggest long-term reason for that loss of value was that the hardware associated with the enhanced communications structures, around the venue for the Summit was removed immediately after the event ended.”\nContemporaneous reports also indicated that as many as 8,000 to 9,500 police and other security personnel were involved in activities related to controlling and managing the potential for disturbances during the period of that Summit. Security arrangements included a significant cohort of private sector, experienced security specialists, from two different companies, who were mostly hosted in so called ‘compounds’ located beside the host hotel.\n“That increased in the days immediately prior to the event as well as during it. But ultimately, disruption in the immediate area was not on a major scale, due mainly to the approach adopted by the local statutory organisations.\n“It is against that background that this study was commissioned; it is designed to ascertain the short and medium-term contribution of that international event to the economy of the immediate area to that of County Fermanagh,” said the report.\nIt cites a previous report entitled ‘Economic Impact of the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland’, produced prior to that Summit, by the University of Ulster and endorsed by Barclays Bank, which suggested that the local economy would secure an immediate, short-term benefit of at least £40 million, based on the benefits achieved by the Gleneagles Summit of July 2005, that ‘global media coverage’ would be worth £70 to 80 million; and the so-called ‘legacy benefits’ such as foreign direct investment, exports and tourism would amount to a further £180 million, over the subsequent three years.\n“While the emphasis in that Ulster University report was on the Northern Ireland economy as a whole, the figures suggested in it were very far from reality.”\nThe report suggests that the U.K. Government committed to paying at least £60 million towards the cost of hosting this Summit, with the balance coming from the Northern Ireland exchequer.\n“But neither the precise costs associated with the event, nor how those costs were actually apportioned or funded, have ever been clarified publicly.\n“The one regret, which became obvious during the production of this report, was that, while leading-edge communication systems added to the success of the Summit, those assets and facilities were not retained in Fermanagh, where they could have increased the benefit from this event, by a major factor. That could have been the real, transformational benefit from this event,” said the report.",

Eyebrow technician Daryl, 24, from Watford, said: \"I love heavily tattooed guys. I've got my eye on Adam, he is beautiful. I like Jack too, and Josh.\" Glazier Alex, 28, from Essex said: \"In the villa, I like Dani. I like Ellie too - she's cute. Dani is very coupled up with Jack so we'll have to see how coupled up they really are when I go in...\" Singer and dancer Savanna, 22, from Sheffield, said: \"When I was a baby, I was on the packaging of a nappy brand. Also, my dad is Kid Creole.\" Socialite Charlie, 23, from Chelsea, said: \"My pals call me 'Snakey Brakey'. I walk over people, even mates. I've got my eye on Megan and Ellie.\" Business management student and fitness coach Frankie, 22, of Cheltenham, said: \"I change my mind who I like everytime I watch the show.\" Office administrator Ellie, 22, from Kent, said: \"I was seeing Jack for a while. I still think there is something there but I would never go back.\" Hairdresser Grace, 25, from London, said: \"I've used a few dating apps. I find you have to go through about 200 men to find a decent one.\" Car salesman Dean, 25, from Burnley, said: \"I like Megan and I would go for Ellie. But I think all the girls are lovely in their own way.\" Tanning shop worker Charlie, 24, from Bath, said: \"The more I watch the show, the more I like Alex. His values are so strong, we'd have a lot in common.\" Model Jordan, 23, from Stockport, said: \"I fancy Ellie and Megan, and Georgia is fit.

			"body": "For 17 years, teenager Luke Pollard was perfectly healthy and showed no signs of the rare genetic condition that would kill him.\n \nLuke died at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle just months after being diagnosed with Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - a condition which affects one in every 75,000 people.\n \nThe Wallsend teenager underwent 12 major operations and had the lower part of his right leg amputated as medics battled in vain to save his young life.\n \nLuke fought for eight gruelling months but tragically died four days before Christmas in 2016 aged only 18.\n \nSpeaking after his inquest at Newcastle Coroner’s Court on Monday, grieving mum Caroline Beckett has bravely opened up about her heartbreak for the first time.\n \nShe said: “It was just so tragic. At the time I just didn’t want to be here myself.\n \n“I don’t think I will ever come to terms with what happened. My son was a perfectly healthy strapping young lad one day, and the next all of this happened.\n \n“I think about him every day and I still struggle.”\n \n \n \n \nBorn at North Tyneside General Hospital, Luke was the youngest of six children and attended Hadrian Park Primary School.\n \nThe Newcastle United fan moved with mum Caroline to Chester in 2010 for a “fresh start” after his dad John died suddenly aged just 46.\n \nThe pair returned to Wallsend three years later, and Luke was enjoying a gardening apprenticeship with the Kier Group at the time his medical nightmare began.\n \nPaying tribute to her son, who harboured long-term ambitions of becoming a mechanic, Caroline said: “He was loved by all.\n \n“Luke was a very cheeky character but funny.\n \n“He knew I loved him to bits, he could get away with things with me. He loved me to bits too, he was so protective of me.\n \n“All in all he was just a lovely young man.”\n \n \n \n \nIn March 2016, Luke started complaining of abdominal pains and was admitted to the Freeman Hospital on April 3.\n \nMedics were forced to carry out emergency operations just three days later due to a ruptured spleen and an aortic aneurysm.\n \nThe blood loss from various ruptured blood vessels was so severe the decision was taken to amputate the lower part of his right leg.\n \nLuke was operated on 10 times before being discharged on August 16, and mum Caroline says the “horrific” experience forever changed her son.\n \nShe said: “He was not the same when he came back. He lost so much weight and was so unhappy, he didn’t want to go out or see anybody.\n \n“I don’t know what was going through his mind. I’m so grateful they got him to a stage he could come home, just to have that little bit of time with him.”\n \n \n \nLuke did not have an explanation until September, when he was diagnosed with Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - one of the most serious forms of a rare genetic condition which causes connective tissue disorder.\n \nConducting her own research online, Caroline was devastated to read the life expectancy for those suffering from the condition was just 40 years.\n \nNothing could be done to save Wallsend teenager battling rare heart condition, inquest hears\n \nShe added: “That upset me then - now I would give anything to have those years looking after him.\n \n“I never told Luke, whether he looked it up himself I don’t know.”\n \nLuke was able to celebrate his 18th birthday at home, but was taken back to the Freeman Hospital on December 14 by ambulance after vomiting blood.\n \nCaroline said: “I knew when he went back that he was not coming back home.”\n \nFurther blood vessel ruptures and another aneurysm were detected, and the 18-year-old underwent two more operations.\n \nJust days later, medics came to the conclusion nothing more could be done to give Luke a realistic chance of survival and he died on December 21.\n \nCaroline added: “The hardest thing was having to sit with him and watch him die.\n \n“I lay beside him holding his hand, I didn’t sleep much as I’d keep looking over to check he was still breathing.\n \n“He is at peace now and he’s with his dad and granddad Jack. He will never be forgotten.”\n \nAssistant coroner Karin Welsh reached a conclusion of death by natural causes, and the inquest heard it was down to Luke’s “strength of character” that he was able to survive so long.\n \n Disabled writer faces heartbreaking prospect of having life-saving surgery cancelled \n \nCaroline says the pain of Luke’s shock passing more than a year on is still raw, and admits she still sends her beloved son a Whatsapp message every day.\n \nNow, the heartbroken mum who one day wishes to start a foundation in Luke’s name has bravely shared his story to raise awareness of the rare and deadly condition which claimed his life in a matter of months.\n \nCaroline finished: “I don’t want anybody else to go through what we’ve been through as a family.\n \n“Luke went through all those operations to try and save his life and after all that, he still passed.\n \n“I want people to realise these things can happen in the blink of an eye. It was a nightmare.\n \n“I’d like more research into the condition, and hopefully one day they can develop a test in children when they are first born.\n \n“I can’t get my head around it at all, I’m just trying to find answers.”",

			"body": "A man who complained about “inconsiderate” road works was left fuming when a blundering council worker left him an abusive voicemail by mistake.\n \nJames Addison, 26, rang Kirklees Council when the access out of his street in Newsome was blocked at both ends by road works.\n \nJames, a physiotherapist in Leeds, said he wanted to enquire why the disruption hadn’t been planned better and also to alert the council that the temporary traffic lights weren’t working.\n \nBut despite chasing up the matter four times over two months he never received an explanation or apology.\n \nHis frustration peaked when instead of getting answers he was left a rude message by a member of staff who did not seem to have a clue what was going on.\n \n \nOn Wednesday, June 13 a council employee rang him but forgot to hang up the call, leaving a four minute long voicemail message of his conversation with a colleague.\n \nWhen James listened to the accidental recording he was shocked to hear the man making fun of him.\n \nHaving failed to get to speak to him, the council worker is overheard being told by another member of staff to email James.\n \nThe man on the phone, who doesn’t realise he is leaving a voicemail, comments: “That will wind him up” and “That will f**king rile him”.\n \nThe caller then starts joking with a colleague, talking about how the Green Cross Code Man was the voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars.\n \nKirklees Council spent &pound;31k on air travel - but says it makes a 'conscious effort' to avoid flying\n \nKirklees Council has denied the offensive comments were directed at James, but he does not agree as he says he had told a manager in the department to email him during a previous call, as he cannot break off from his work to answer the phone.\n \n“All I was complaining about was roadworks,” said James.\n \n“Instead of an apology I got that.\n \n“I just wanted to know why they’d done them both at the same time as it seems pretty inconsiderate to residents, but receiving that voicemail took my frustration to the next level.”\n \nJames said all he wanted from council chiefs now was an apology and an explanation to his two month old inquiry.\n \n \nKarl Battersby, Strategic Director for Economy and Infrastructure said: “Unfortunately on this occasion the council failed to deliver the level of customer service that our residents deserve.\n \n“Prior to the phone call, the customer had contacted the council to report concerns over the number of roadworks undertaken by utility companies in the Cross Lane/Primrose Hill area.\n \n“The customer had requested a call back from the council and this didn’t take place.\n \n“When the call was passed through, an officer called back to get some more information.\n \n&quot;It was pretty cool&quot; Kirklees' first female Sikh councillor on being elected by her home town\n \n“When the call ended he failed to close the call correctly and conversations in the office were recorded.\n \n“Whilst initial investigations suggest that the conversation was not directly about the caller, the conversation that took place was unprofessional and not in line with our expectations of staff.\n \n“The members of staff involved will be spoken to and appropriate action will be taken to ensure that this behaviour is not repeated.\n \n“We would like to offer Mr Addison a full apology for both our failure to deal with his enquiry in a timely manner and for any distress the recorded conversation may have caused.”",

			"body": "An online dealer who pedalled poisonous 'slimming pills' that killed a 21-year-old student was found guilty of manslaughter.\n \nVulnerable Eloise Parry, from Shrewsbury, was bulimic and died on April 12 2015 after taking eight tablets containing the toxic Dinitrophenol (DNP).\n \nA Sudbury Hill raid by Harrow Council in February 2016 led to the prosecution, of Gosport steroid dealer Bernard Rebelo, 31, who was found guilty of two counts of manslaughter and one of placing unsafe food on the market, at Inner London Crown Court on Wednesday (June 27).\n \nThe landmark case brought by Harrow Council led to the first DNP manslaughter conviction.\n \nWest London latest \nRebelo, who will be sentenced on Friday (June 29) admitted while giving evidence during the trial that he sold DNP to Miss Parry.\n \n \nHe told the jury that he included a warning on his website that the substance was not for human consumption.\n \nRebelo's girlfriend Mary Roberts, 32, was cleared by the jury of one count of money laundering after she was accused of transferring &pound;20,000 for and on behalf of Rebelo.\n \nMs Roberts said she had never seen capsules for making pills where she lived and if she had she would have asked her partner Rebelo why they were there.\n \nShe also said she had taken little interest in asking details of a business Rebelo had set up to sell &quot;muscle enhancing supplements and protein shakes&quot;.\n \nThe couple wept in the dock as the verdicts were delivered on Wednesday afternoon, with Rebelo asking the judge: &quot;Can I see my daughter?&quot;\n \nMs Roberts could be heard crying as the couple hugged one another.\n \nThe jury had begun its deliberations on Tuesday (June 26) afternoon.\n \nMiss Parry died after taking eight diet pills containing the highly toxic DNP.\n \nHer sister Rebecca Parry, now aged 19, said in a statement read out during the trial that she had been &quot;focused&quot; on losing weight.\n \n \nShe noted that in the weeks and months leading up to her death, her sister had struggled &quot;more and more&quot; with her eating disorder.\n \nShe said: &quot;The diet pills she had taken had made her lose a drastic amount of weight but she still wanted to be slimmer.&quot;\n \nRebecca Parry said she left Eloise's house on April 11 at about 9pm and that her sister, who had been talking about doing a Master's degree, seemed happy but tired. She had leg pain.\n \nRebecca said: &quot;She mentioned a takeaway but I told her not to order one unless she was sure she could eat it.&quot;\n \nShe added that the next day it looked to her as though she had binged before taking the diet pills.\n \nShe recalled that her sister had struggled with her mental health during her teenage years and had been diagnosed with bulimia and a borderline personality disorder.\n \nIn the weeks leading up to her death, she was admitted to hospital numerous times because of the side effects of DNP, according to Rebecca Parry.\n \n \nJurors were told that Miss Parry started taking the chemical in pill form in February 2015, and soon became addicted and dependent on the yellow powder in the capsules.\n \nThe trial heard that among other things, DNP could cause multiple organ failure, hypothermia, nausea, coma, muscle rigidity, cardiac arrest and death.\n \nThe court heard that depending on body weight, just 200mg of DNP can be lethal.\n \nHarrow council leader, Graham Henson, said: &quot;We brought this case because we were the last chance for justice for the family of a vulnerable young woman, who was poisoned by the vile toxins that this criminal knowingly peddled.\n \n&quot;Harrow Council had the best chance in years to bring those responsible to justice and help prevent the same fate befalling another innocent victim in the future. We simply had to take that chance.&quot;",

Some gentle sea breezes will develop around coasts, making it feel more comfortable here, but the maximum temperature could reach as high as 30C again.\n \nAlthough the heat has remained consistent throughout the week, chief Met Office meteorologist Paul Gundersen has said they are expecting temperatures to increase further over the next couple of days.\n \n How to spot the signs of heatstroke and heat exhaustion in children and babies \n \nHe said: &quot;For the first time this year, we have seen temperatures very locally top 30.0C, with 30.1C on Monday.\n \n&quot;However, we are anticipating that temperatures will increase further over the next couple of days and remain high by the weekend: it's possible that some locations could reach 32.0C.\n \n \nWeather widget for articles \n&quot;The focus for the highest temperatures is expected to shift towards the west of the UK into the middle of the week, and then northwest, before temperatures potentially begin to hot up again in the south over the weekend.&quot;\n \nA recorded temperature of 32C would make that the hottest day in Liverpool ever recorded.\n \n What happened to our lidos? And wouldn't it be lovely if we still had them \n \nThe last time the mercury hit anywhere near those temperatures was when a record 30 was recorded on July 19, 2016.\n \nIt also reached 30 in Liverpool on July 19, 2013.\n \n \nPublic Health England (PHE) says that a 30 daytime temperature in the North West is enough to trigger an official heatwave.\n \nGovernment bodies began to publish annual plans to deal with heat after the record-breaking heatwave of summer 2003, which caused 2,000 excess deaths in England and 15,000 in northern France.\n \n Schools relax uniform rules as 'blowtorch' heatwave hits Liverpool \n \nThese are the hottest recorded days in Liverpool over the past decade:\n \n \n 19/07/2016 - 30&deg;C \n 19/07/2013 - 30&deg;C \n 19/06/2017 - 28&deg;C \n 30/06/2015 - 28&deg;C \n 25/07/2014 - 28&deg;C \n 18/07/2013 - 28&deg;C \n 02/07/2009 -28&deg;C \n 28/07/2008 - 28 &deg;C \n",

A ‘Wild Day Out’ will take centre stage at Carlton Marshes on Saturday, July 7 as people are given the chance to see Suffolk Wildlife Trust’s vision for 1,000 acres of wildness and a new visitor centre. In April it was announced that the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) would award £4,063,000 to realise Suffolk Wildlife Trust’s vision of a landscape-scale nature reserve. The Trust will take ownership of the new land – a parcel of 348 acres surrounding Carlton Marshes – early in July. To mark the completion of the purchase, which means the Trust can now begin to build a new visitor centre and start what will be the most ambitious habitat creation project seen in the Broads for more than a decade, a celebration day will be held with Waveney MP Peter Aldous among the dignitaries. Matt Gooch, Suffolk Wildlife Trust’s Broads Warden, said: “Buying the land is the culmination of a tremendous effort by so many people across Suffolk and beyond, and our Wild Day Out on July 7 is a chance for everyone to share in the excitement of the land purchase. “I would like to invite you to join us at any time from 11am to 3pm to hear more about our plans for the reserve from the Trust team who will be leading the project and to thank you for your part in making it happen.”",

She said: \"I like tall, dark and handsome! I am really tattooed so I love heavily tattooed guys but I also like people who have good chat and banter, someone who isn't too serious. \"In the villa, I've got my eye on Adam, he is beautiful.

He said: \"It would be nice to find someone that I genuinely click with; obviously there are a lot of good looking people in there, but I'd like to end up finding someone I really like. \"I change my mind in terms of who I like every time I watch it - but at the moment it is probably Ellie and Zara. \"They both seem cool and chatty. They're most similar to my usual type.\" He will face competition from Dean Overson, 25, a car salesman from Burnley, who said: \"They've got to have a lovely smile. \"I like nice eyes and I want a girl to have a bit about them, someone you can speak to and who can hold a conversation. \"I like Megan and I'd go for Ellie.

There were some confrontations with some of the residents.\n \n \n“We are planning to carry out another bin protest next week and thinking about other methods.\n \n“The community has come together. We really mean business now.”\n \n“We want a parking scheme in Hulme, we are not going to give up.\n \n“It is dangerous, somebody is going to get hurt.”\n \nCoun Angeliki Stogia, Executive Member for Environment, Transport and Planning, said: “Our manifesto in the recent local elections, which is now council policy, includes developing a comprehensive set of parking policies which discourage commuter and non-resident parking in residential areas.\n \n \n“In this case we’ve been meeting with residents regularly to discuss the problems caused in this area by commuter parking and plans are in motion for the introduction of a parking permit scheme. We will meet with residents again in the near future to update them on our progress towards this goal.”\n \nEarlier this year, the Department for Transport said it is considering rolling out a nationwide ban on pavement parking.\n \nParking on pavements is not currently illegal in the UK outside London. Under the Highway Code, drivers can still face punishment for pavement parking if they cause a serious inconvenience to blind people, parents with pushchairs and wheelchair users.\n \nHowever, if the new law is enforced drivers could be fined &pound;70 for parking on the pavement.",

			"body": " Fuming Feltham residents are to stage a protest against Hounslow Council's &quot;aggressive redevelopment&quot; plans which threaten to replace a string of community sites with high rise flats. \n \n Campaigners will picket Hounslow's Civic Centre from 6pm on July 5 with the central aim of getting Feltham's historic showman site in Station Estate Road removed from the Feltham Masterplan, which has it earmarked it, along with several other community buildings, for redevelopment. \n \nA Facebook group to save the Feltham Showman site has gathered nearly 10,000 members in just two weeks.\n \nWhile the showman site is central to the protest, residents are also campaigning to save the Feltham Scouts hall and the Sparrow Farm residents association's club, which are both at risk of council redevelopment.\n \nWest London latest \nProtest organiser and community campaigner, Garvin Snell, has lived in Westmacott Drive, Feltham, for 33 years.\n \nHe said: &quot;It just feels like we're not being listened too. They are aggressively building on every spare bit of land in the area and are looking to develop on every empty space.\n \n&quot;They say they're here to work with the community and are doing it with our backing, but I don't know who's backing them, none of us do! Even though they hold public consultations it's like we're not listened to.&quot;\n \n&quot;The area's being totally over-developed with tall blocks of flats going up everywhere, the one's opposite the station are going to be 10 storeys high- this protest is against high rise flats going up all over Feltham. It's because we're fed up of the council not listening to the us and to the community.&quot;\n \n \nProtesters will gather outside Hounslow Civic Centre on July 5 - the same evening councillors are due to meet for a planning meeting.\n \nAccording to Mr Snell, at least 500 community campaigners will carry placards and banners and be handing out leaflets on the night. The campaigners hope to get the attention of Hounslow Council Leader Steve Curran who is expected to attend the planning meeting.\n \nMr Snell added: &quot;We want to get them to listen. We know council leader Steven Curran will be there and we want the protest to get his attention.&quot;\n \nHe added: &quot;We feel cheated and lied to at the moment.&quot;\n \n \nCouncillor Steve Curran, Leader of Hounslow Council, has responded to the petition.\n \n He told getwestlondon : &quot;Hounslow, alongside many other London boroughs, is facing a major crisis in housing, at the heart of which is the lack of supply of truly affordable homes. The new London Plan requires Hounslow to provide 21,800 new homes over the next 10 years - an increase of 165% from our previous target of 8,220 units in the previous 10 years. \n \n“The Hounslow statutory Local Plan sets out the Council’s aspiration for the development of the borough over the next 15 years. On the recommendation of the Government’s Planning Inspectorate, the Council is currently carrying out a review of this Plan, in relation to the west of the borough, and the Great West Corridor, to plan to better accommodate new pressures for housing growth and employment opportunities.\n \n &quot;The Reviews of the Plan are subject, by law, to public consultations at specific intervals. The Local Plan Reviews can be viewed here . \n \n \n“The West of Borough Review is informed by the Feltham Masterplan. The Feltham Masterplan was produced to consider how the Feltham area could be physically developed over the next 15 years.\n \n“The Masterplan is not a statutory document, but it forms part of the evidence base for the West of the Borough Plan which will have statutory weight when adopted.\n \n&quot;The Masterplan identifies the Station Estate Road &quot;Travelling Show People's&quot; site as having potential for redevelopment for housing due to its close proximity to the train station and town centre. Following a six-week public consultation, which took place from 20 January to 3 March 2017, the Masterplan was approved in September 2017.\n \n&quot;Whilst the Travelling Show People’s site is shown as part of the Feltham Masterplan, no final decision on the development of the site has been taken. Before we can do so we must continue to engage with the Travelling Show People, and agree a suitable alternative site for their possible relocation.&quot;\n \n \nCllr Curran says the council have carried out assessments to identify a suitable alternative site, including meeting with the Travelling Show People community.\n \n These Feltham families who run west London's funfairs could be kicked out of their homes \n \nHe added: &quot;We will continue to engage and listen to our community to understand their needs before any final decisions on developments are taken.\n \n&quot;The council has proposed a redevelopment of the Sparrow Farm centre to provide a new community centre, which will provide modern, flexible space for a variety of community activities; and 25 new council homes for London Borough of Hounslow residents on the councils waiting list.\n \n&quot;Since October 2016, we have carried out extensive consultations over our proposals for the development of the Sparrow Farm site, including many meetings with the Sparrow Farm Residents Association. We continue to engage with the Sparrow Farm community.\n \n&quot;We are currently working with the local community to find out what they would like to use the community spaces, for example, creche facilities, social events, education and training, clubs, or other possible activities. When completed the development will provide valuable space and opportunities to meet the needs of the community.&quot;",

			"body": "Cyber security expert warns that people whose personal or payment information has been breached should now be on the lookout for follow-up scams. Ticketmaster has suffered a security breach affecting up to 40,000 UK customers . Malicious software on third-party customer support product Inbenta Technologies caused the hack, the firm said on Twitter. “Some personal or payment information may have been accessed by an unknown third party”, it added. All affected customers have been contacted. In the email to those customers, Ticketmaster said it had set up a website to answer any questions and advised them to reset their passwords. It also offered them a free 12-month identity monitoring service. It said the breach was likely to have only affected UK customers who purchased or attempted to purchase tickets between February and 23 June 2018. But, as a precaution, it said it had also informed international customers who had purchased or attempted to purchase tickets between September 2017 and 23 June 2018. The company added that North American customers were not affected. Information that may have been compromised includes names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, payment details and Ticketmaster log-in details. It said that “forensic teams and security experts are working around the clock” to understand how data was compromised. Brooks Wallace from the cyber-security specialist Trusted Knight said members of the public should now be on the lookout for follow-up scams. He said: “After an incident like this, criminals from around the world will jump at the chance to try and catch a few unsuspecting people out.",

			"body": "Brazil booked their place in the last 16 of the World Cup with a hard-fought 2-0 win against Serbia in Moscow this evening (Wednesday).\n \nIt was a game that didn't really get going in the first half, with chances few and far between at both ends.\n \nNeymar had the best opportunity of the first half hour for Brazil, but he saw his effort saved well by Vladimir Stojkovic.\n \nBut the South Americans did make the breakthrough on 35 minutes, with former Spurs man Paulinho making a run from midfield to latch onto Philippe Coutinho's incisive pass, before lifting the ball over the top of Stojkovic for the opener.\n \n World Cup player ratings: Kante and Hazard in top form but Willian is having a mixed time \n \n \n \nSerbia had chances to equalise early on in the second half as they got on top, with Aleksandar Mitrovic guilty of missing the best of them, heading straight at Thiago Silva after Brazil goalkeeper Alisson parried a cross into his path.\n \nAnd Brazil made them pay midway through the second half as Thiago Silva rose highest to head home Neymar's inswinging corner.\n \nSerbia rarely threatened thereafter as Brazil comfortably saw out the game to go through as Group E winners.\n \nHere's how we rated the players from both sides, below.\n \nSERBIA \n \n  \nGoalkeeper - Vladimir Stojkovic \nMade a superb stop to deny Neymar as he looked to break the deadlock, getting a firm hand to palm his shot away. Also saved with his feet to deny Neymar in the second half, but may feel he could have done better with Brazil's opener. 6\n \nRight-back - Antonio Rukavina \nDid alright for the most part against the test provided by Neymar on Brazil's left, but was beaten on a few occasions down his side. 5\n \nCentre-back - Nikola Milenkovic \nMade a few important interceptions and clearances in defence. But was beaten in the air for Brazil's second goal. 5\n \nCentre-back - Milos Veljkovic \nHelped to contain the forward threat of Jesus, Neymar and Willian, but was found wanting with the ball over the top for Paulinho's goal. 5\n \nLeft-back - Aleksandar Kolarov \n \nPicked out by the ITV pundits as being at fault for failing to come inside to track Paulinho's run for Brazil's opening goal. And had a relatively poor game by his standards. 4\n \nCentre midfielder - Nemanja Matic \nA typical display from the midfielder, who got his foot in when necessary. His influence faded in the second half though and he was booked for fouling Gabriel Jesus. 5\n \n Some Crystal Palace fans are saying the same thing as Serbia fall behind against Brazil \n \nCentre midfielder - Sergej Milinkovic-Savic \nPlaying in a deeper role alongside Matic, he was not really given the freedom to excel going forward, particularly in the first half. He showed some flashes of his ability in the second half, but this was not his best game. 6\n \nAttacking midfielder - Adem Ljajic \nThe Torino man was brought into the side for this decisive game, with Mladen Krstajic opting for more attack-minded personnel in a must-win game for the Serbians. He looked to get on the ball when possible, and put a couple of dangerous balls into the box, but was booked for a cynical foul on Neymar. 7\n \nRight winger - Dusan Tadic \n \nOn the day a deal was announced for him to join Ajax from Southampton, he showed glimpses of his creativity and what the Saints will miss. He had a few good moments in the game, but not enough of them. 6 \n \nLeft winger - Filip Kostic \nProvided an outlet for Serbia on the left wing and caused Fagner problems, particularly in the first half. He also showed his strength and ability on the ball at times, but faded before being substituted. 7\n \nStriker - Aleksandar Mitrovic \n \nWas a handful for the Brazilian defenders, with his physical presence causing some problems, but he wasn't used enough by Serbia as they failed to really make the most of his threat. He still had Serbia's best opportunity, but somehow missed when he really should have scored. 6\n \nWorld Cup fans realise what Fulham already knew about Newcastle striker Aleksandr Mitrovic\n \nSubstitutes: \nAndrija Zivkovic (on for Ljajic, 75) \nBrought on as Serbia tried to chase the game, but failed to have much of an impact. 5\n \nNemanja Radonjic (on for Kostic, 82) \nBrought on for the final eight minutes of normal time, but didn't really influence the game. 5\n \nLuka Jovic (on for Mitrovic, 89)\n \nNot enough time to make an impact. 5\n \nBrazil \n \nGoalkeeper: Alisson\n \nDidn't have too much to do in the Brazil goal as Serbia failed to really test him, but almost gifted Serbia an equaliser as he parried a cross straight into Mitrovic's path, only for the striker to head straight at Thiago Silva. 5\n \nRight-back: Fagner \n \nStruggled at times against Kostic, conceding a number of free kicks as Serbia got some joy down his side. 4\n \nCentre-back: Thiago Silva\n \n \nWas superb at the back for Brazil and put his body on the line at times to make some crucial blocks, including one to deny Mitrovic. He capped off his performance with the second goal midway through the second half. 8\n \nCentre-back: Miranda \n \nHad his hands full with Mitrovic, but was solid enough to help Brazil keep a clean sheet. 7\n \nLeft-back: Marcelo \n \nLooked uncomfortable early on and did not make it past ten minutes, as he was substituted for Filipe Luis. 5\n \n \n \nCentre midfielder: Casemiro \n \nWas relatively quiet throughout the game, and was only really notable for a wild shot from distance that flew high over the bar. 5\n \nCentre midfielder: Paulinho \n \nScored the opening goal after a fine burst from midfield, showing composure to lift the ball over the advancing Stojkovic. He faded in the second half, before being substituted. 7\n \nCentre midfielder: Philippe Coutinho \n \nRarely gave the ball away and provided a good link between midfield and attack. Also provided the assist for Paulinho with a superbly weighted pass to split the Serbia defence open. 8\n \nForward: Willian\n \n \nWas better than his last display, but was still wasteful at times when in a good position. Has not recreated the form he has shown at times for Chelsea. 6\n \n Brazil 2-0 Costa Rica player ratings: Willian disappoints as Coutinho saves the day \n \nStriker: Gabriel Jesus\n \nTried to get involved, but didn't really have any clear cut opportunities. Still worked hard up top and contributed to the victory. 6\n \nForward: Neymar\n \nKept quiet in the first half by Serbia, and failed to make the most of a couple of good positions. He tried a couple of flicks and tricks, and put in the corner for Thiago Silva's goal, but still needs to do more at this tournament to justify the hype around him. 6\n \nSubstitutes - \nFilipe Luis (on for Marcelo, 10) \n \nThe former Chelsea man was introduced into the fray early on, with Marcelo unable to carry on. He was comfortable enough at left-back without doing anything spectacular. 6\n \nFernandinho (on for Paulinho, 66)\n \nCame on to shore up things for Brazil after an early second half wobble. And Brazil looked more comfortable after his introduction. Also showed his ability on the ball. 7\n \nRenato Augusto (on for Coutinho, 80) \n \nGiven a run out for the final ten minutes as Coutinho was given a rest. 5\n \nKeep up to date with the latest news, features and exclusives from football.london via the free football.london app for iPhone and Android.\n \nAvailable to download from the App Store and Google Play.",

			"body": "There was penalty drama as Costa Rica managed to get a 2-2 draw with Switzerland and their first points of the tournament.\n \nCosta Rica were unlucky not to break the deadlock - they hit the post first and then a Daniel Colindres piledriver crashed against the crossbar.\n \nSwitzerland took the lead despite being under the cosh somewhat in the opening period, and on the half hour mark Stephan Lichtsteiner found Breel Embolo, who nodded it back to Blerim Dzemaili to smash home.\n \nThe second half started in the same form, with Costa Rica threatening early on before Switzerland themselves started to out efforts on goal, with Embolo coming close.\n \nBut Costa Rica got their first goal of the World Cup when Watson rose highest from corner to nod home and get his country level.\n \nThe Swiss nearly found themselves ahead when substitute Josip Drmic nodded an Embolo cross against the crossbar with 12 minutes left in the tie.\n \nBut he got his goal with just three minutes remaining when he connected with a cross on the edge of the box and slotted home.\n \nCosta Rica then thought they had got themselves a penalty just a minute later, but VAR intervened as Bryan Ruiz was ruled out for offside.\n \nHowever, they managed to get themselves another penalty, with Ruiz smashing the crossbar before the ball bounced back, hit Sommer and went into the net.\n \n South Korea 2-0 Germany player ratings: Son scores to send Ozil crashing out of the World Cup \n \nSwitzerland  \nGoalkeeper: Yann Sommer - 7\n \nStunning save within five minutes to deny Costa Rica, tipping the header onto the post. Looked uncomfortable coming for crosses but an otherwise good display.\n \nRight back: Stephan Lichtsteiner - 8\n \nProduced a wonderful cross for the opening goal to find Embolo. Had a solid game at right back and caused Costa Rica problems going forward.\n \nCentre back: Fabian Schar - 6\n \nDecent game at the back for Schar who marshaled his backline well as Costa Rica looked to find more goals.\n \nCentre back: Manuel Akanji - 7\n \nSolid game from the central defender, who at 22 showed maturity beyond his years in the heart of the Swiss defence. Should've done better when marking his man at the corner that Costa Rica scored from.\n \n \n \n \nLeft back: Ricardo Rodriguez - 6\n \nLooked better going forward than he did defensively as he struggled to contain Colindres, who enjoyed far too much time out on his wing.\n \nDefensive midfielder: Granit Xhaka - 7\n \nGot on the ball in midfield and was Switzerland's link between defence and attack. Put himself about as he tried to break up the Costa Rican attacks.\n \nDefensive midfielder: Valon Behrami - 6\n \nDecent showing in the defensive midfield role without ever really exceeding expectations for Switzerland. Subbed off at 60, probably with the fact he was at risk of missing the next round on the manager's mind.\n \nAttacking midfielder: Xherdan Shaqiri - 7\n \nLooked in the mood early on, full of skill and willing to attack the left back. Was the main man in the second half as he got on the ball and looked to make things happen for his country.\n \nAttacking midfielder: Blerim Dzemaili - 7\n \nDemonstrated a good reading of the game to be waiting in the middle of the box to get his goal. Seemed to arrive in the right places at the right time.\n \n \n \n \nAttacking midfielder: Breel Embolo - 8\n \nShowed good awareness to nod his header back to Dzemaili for the opening goal. Had a few chances in the second half as he proved to be a thorn in the side of the Costa Rican defence.\n \nForward: Mario Gavranovic - 5\n \nLargely anonymous performance from the forward, who didn't really get a chance to put his mark on the game, Was subbed off on the 68th minute.\n \nSubsitutes: \nDenis Zakaria (Valon Behrami 59') - 5\n \nDid very little in the midfield after coming on for Behrami.\n \nJosip Drmic (Mario Gavranovic 68') - 8\n \nUnlucky not to get himself a goal when he rose well to connect with a good Embolo cross with 12 minutes left. Really good finish to get his goal from the edge of the box. Good sub from the boss.\n \nMichael Lang (Xherdan Shaqiri 80') - 5\n \nDidn't have enough time to have a say on proceedings.\n \n What Germany's shock exit means for Mesut Ozil and Antonio Rudiger at Arsenal &amp; Chelsea \n \nCosta Rica  \nGoalkeeper: Keylor Navas - 6\n \nDidn't have too much to do but made a few decent saves, while his communication and distribution was good.\n \nLeft back: Kendall Watson - 7\n \nShowed great strength to rise highest from the corner, holding off the challenge of Akanji to nod home the goal for Costa Rica.\n \nCentre back: Giancarlo Gonzalez - 6\n \nHad a difficult start to the game but got to terms with Costa Rica's attacking players more as the game went on.\n \nRight back: Johnny Acosta - 7\n \nShowed some nice displays of defensive work during the game and looked to use his wing backs well.\n \n \n \n \nLeft midfielder: Bryan Oviedo - 7\n \nReally struggled with Shaqiri this evening as the Swiss man's skill caused Oviedo problem after problem. Attacked well down his flank and looked one of the ones to make something happen.\n \nCentral midfielder: David Guzman - 7\n \nWas combative in the middle of the park as he looked to put himself about and disrupt Switzerland when they were in possession. Released some nice passes for his front men to thrive off\n \nCentral midfielder: Celso Borges - 6\n \nAverage performance in the middle of the park from Borges. Put in a few nice touches.\n \nRight midfielder: Cristian Gamboa - 6\n \nHad a decent performance down the right and caused Switzerland some problems from time to time.\n \nLeft forward: Bryan Ruiz - 5\n \nCruised through the game without really do much for his side. Struggled to get on the ball much and was largely ineffective.\n \n \n \nRight forward: Joel Campbell - 7\n \nStarted the game brightly and caused problems down the right flank. Got himself the assist with a lovely taken corner. Was a bit quieter as the game wore on but he'll be pleased with his performance.\n \n \n \n \nCentral Forward: Daniel Colindres - 7\n \nCapitalised on Shaqiri giving the ball away cheaply and unleashed a wonderful effort that crashed off the bar. Fizzled out as the second half wore on.\n \nSubstitutes: \nRodney Wallace (Daniel Colindres 80') - 5\n \nDidn't have enough time to affect proceedings.\n \nRandall Azofeifa (David Guzman) - 5\n \nNo time to affect the game.\n \nJordan Smith - 5\n \nHad no time to affect the game.\n \n \n \n Why Arsenal, Liverpool and Man United's reported interest in Heung-Min Son doesn't make sense \n \nKeep up to date with the latest news, features and exclusives from football.london via the free football.london app for iPhone and Android.\n \n \n \nAvailable to download from the App Store and Google Play.",

			"body": "An expert panel announced by the Government began accepting applications for licences for the drug from senior clinicians on Wednesday after cannabis U-turn. Prescriptions for medicinal cannabis in exceptional cases could be available within a fortnight. An expert panel announced by the Government amid an outcry over the case of severely epileptic boy Billy Caldwell began accepting applications for licences for the drug from senior clinicians on Wednesday. The Home Office announced the panel will make \"swift\" recommendations to ministers, who will then sign off on applications within two to four weeks. If given approval, doctors can then start writing prescriptions for their patient, while ministers decide whether to remove cannabis's banned status as a medicine. Doctors will have to show there is an \"exceptional clinical need\" and no other medicine would be suitable for their patient in order to convince the panel. They would also have to accept \"full responsibility for risks and liability\", the Home Office said. The panel was announced during the controversy surrounding the department's confiscation of cannabis oil from Charlotte Caldwell as she attempted to bring it into the UK for her 12-year-old son. A 20-day emergency licence was granted for Billy, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, after he was admitted to hospital in a critical condition having suffered multiple seizures. The panel is a temporary measure while Chief Medical Officer Professor Dame Sally Davies carries out a review into whether cannabis should be made available for therapeutic use. The Government also announced it would review how much the NHS must pay for a licence, which currently stands at £3,655. The Home Office said patients and their families will not be asked to contribute to the cost. The panel will begin meeting this week and will be led by Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride. Policing minister Nick Hurd said the panel will ensure patients get the best treatment based on medical evidence. \"Clinicians must be at the heart of the process to provide the reassurance that prescribing unlicensed and potentially untested products is in the best interests of the patient,\" he added.",

READ MORE: Calderdale Council issue warning over moorland firesHolidaymaker Kate MacRae, 48, snapped the scene from a plane when she spotted huge palls of smoke rising into the sky from her seat. She was returning to Manchester Airport from a trip to the Shetlands via Aberdeen when she spotted the clouds of smoke as the plane was descending to land. Kate described the scene as ‘looking like a volcano.’ She said: “It was about 7pm on Monday when I was coming in to land that I noticed the smoke. “It looked like a volcano with the plumes of smoke rising up into the air. I took some pictures on my phone through the plane window and thought nothing more about it. “It was only when I saw the blaze on the telly last night I realised I had photographed the early stages of it. “From a distance, it looked like a huge volcanic eruption.” More than 30 homes have been evacuated as the fire service struggle to take hold of the huge flames. The blaze has been declared a “major incident” with the Army is on standby to step in if needed. The fire began on Sunday night, reignited on Monday during the hot weather and then spread throughout Tuesday, fanned by evening winds. Thirty-four homes in Carrbrook, near Stalybridge, Gtr Mancs., were evacuated but there are no reported injuries. Smoke has completely engulfed the village, with locals advised to keep windows closed and for asthmatics to continue taking their medication. The fire, which measures 3.7 miles (6km) across the tinder-dry hills, has been raging for days despite efforts to halt it. Great Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) confirmed the blaze was spreading and said crews have recommended “offensive firefighting”. Assistant Chief Fire Officer Leon Parkes said there are ten fire engines and 50 firefighters at the scene facing “enormous” challenges against the blaze which has “pockets” occurring in different areas. Smoke and flames can still be seen for miles but Mr Parkes said crews had “quelled the risk” to homes at risk from the flames. He said it had not been established what might have caused the fire. Fire crews used a helicopter to drop water on the fire on Tuesday, and Mr Parkes said the blaze had “presented some real challenges to the fire and rescue service in terms of access”. Firefighter Ricky Case, who has been out on the hills, said: “It’s just the sheer vastness of it. It’s one of the biggest ones I’ve been on in a long time. The logistics of it all, trying to get water to the locations where we need it.” GMFRS group manager for Tameside, Phil Nelson, added: “Crews are still tackling this difficult fire and are working hard to contain the blaze and prevent further fire spread. “Firefighters are faced with very difficult circumstances, intense heat and are working on challenging terrain. “Our main considerations are for crew welfare. It is physically draining working at this incident and it is vital that our firefighters have regular breaks and that relief crews are available to take over.” On Tuesday night, GMP said more than 30 homes in Carr Rise, Carr Lane and Calico Crescent were being evacuated due to the proximity of the flames. Calico Crescent resident Dee Blanchard, 28, stayed at home through the night to help save animals and pets on the street, including cats and hedgehogs. She is a former military police officer who served in Afghanistan and Iraq but admitted she’s now starting to get nervous. “We went outside and there was just this fire crackling literally on the hill behind the house. The smoke was acrid and thick. We could hardly see,” she said.",

			"body": "Four fire engines raced to the scene of a scrap yard which had caught alight and will continue burning until after midnight due to low water supplies. Firefighters have been battling the blaze since the early evening with large plumes of black smoke travelling across the countryside. Residents in Harlow could see the thick smoke and believed it was coming from the Potter Street area of thew town, but it has been confirmed the fire began in a scrap yard in the Foster Street area towards the east. Four fire crews were dispatched, two from Harlow and one each from Old Harlow and Epping, to battle the blaze at around 6:31pm today (Wednesday, June 27). When firefighters arrived they were met with a stack of timber, a diesel tank and scrap cars alight, and rushed to remove gas cylinders away from the embers. They have worked hard to stop the fire from spreading to other units in the same area but have also been battling low water supplies. Crews have had to create a shuttle where they are travelling to the fire hydrant to collect the much-needed water and bring it back to the scene. Richard Green, Station Manager, speaking at the scene at around 8.30pm, said \"It's been unfortunate a large fire started in a scrap yard and fire crews have been working really hard in the hot weather and conditions, but we have got the fire surrounded. \"It will be burning for another three to four hours due to poor water supplies and we're struggling but we are dealing with it. \"We're doing the best we can the crews have done really well at stopping it spreading from other areas and other properties. \"We will carry out an investigation and it is cool enough to walk on.\" The station manager continued: \"We have a water shuttle which is travelling backwards and forwards to fill up and supply the engine. \"There is no obstruction to the road way. If people are concerned of the smoke, they should pass with their windows closed.\" Smoke was travelling across the fields in the surrounding areas. Firefighters remain at the scene dealing with the fire but say they are making progress as the smoke has turned white. The Control Room at Essex County Fire and Rescue received dozens of emergency calls reporting the fire as it could be seen from as far as the M11. An ECFRS statement says: \"Firefighters were called to a fire at a scrap yard in North Weald Bassett, Epping at 6.31pm. \"The Control Room received dozens of 999 calls reporting the fire as lots of smoke could be seen from the M11. \"When fire crews arrived they reported the fire involved a number of scrap cars, cylinders and a diesel tank.\" It is not yet known what started the fire at the scrap yard but the crews will conduct an investigation when it is safe to do so.",

They sound great!”\n \nEntries for Best Places to Work came in from around the region, with judges scoring companies on factors such as staff development, perks and bonuses, community involvement and staff engagement.",

The actions of the officers and PCSO’s who attended the incident, arrested Cooper and identified key evidence were today recognised by Chief Supt Barton who awarded them a Good Work Minute for their actions.",

			"body": "A woman discovered her husband and son had drowned while magnet fishing when she rang her spouse's phone and the police answered, an inquest heard. Angela Andrews was concerned that husband Martin Andrews and son Jack had not returned from their fishing trip when she called. Father and son Martin, 43, and Jack, 19, are believed to have been trawling the bottom of the canal with a magnet when they lost their lives on June 16. The pair had gone out early that morning and Angela had expected them home at lunchtime. At an inquest today (Tues), coroner Paul Dennison said: “The police were alerted by a member of the public after a number of personal items were found on the canal bank. “The police arrived at the scene at the Cooper Bridge area where a mobile phone was ringing. “An officer answered and spoke to Mr Andrew's wife who was calling because she was concerned of their whereabouts. “She said they had gone out magnet fishing at 6.30am and she was expecting them home at around lunchtime.” Speaking prior to the inquest, Angela Andrews, 44, described her husband and son as “heroes”. However, she explained her tragic last words to the pair were “don’t go into the water.” Martin and Jack Andrews were found by police divers at 7pm on June 16, after a local dog walker spotted their belongings on the canal bank at Cooper Bridge near Brighouse. Angela said: ''I feel like I've been robbed of my future. \"I told them that when I went to see them at the chapel of rest, like how, how can you just leave us like that. ''I never got to kiss him goodbye that morning cos I was in the shower when they left. \"And my last words were 'stay safe, be careful - don't go in the water'. “But somehow - they did end up in the water. Their bodies were found a few hours later. ''They were together, in the bottom of the lock. Round each other, so it looked like, one had fallen in, the other had gone after. “They're both heroes to me, they've tried to save each other.'' Martin and Jack had only recently discovered magnet fishing - and had bonded over collecting many old an unusual items. Angela said: ''It came about because my brother came across a bottle - an old glass bottle - in the river and really wanted to find out about it, and he thought I wonder what else we could find. “So we got the magnets, magnet fishing, and it properly brought them together.'' Angela said she is taking comfort from the community - including efforts to fundraise for their funerals. She said: ''The support has been overwhelming. I’ve not opened any cards yet. For the reason that they started arriving on Father's day.'' She said every Father's Day will be a reminder of the tragedy - but also a reminder of the bond between Martin and Jack - who died doing something they loved. She added: \"That's one of the things making me feel strong. I know they were together. And they had hours of fun before the tragedy happened.'' The police summoned the underwater search team who retrieved the fully submerged bodies of Martin and Jack at 7pm. They were tragically pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics at 7.15pm. Coroner Peter Merchant confirmed the cause of death was drowning after a post-mortem was carried out on the bodies by Dr Lisa Barker on June 19.",

			"body": "The innocent 20-year-old victim suffered two broken hips in the horrific incident which turned out to be a case of mistaken identity. Police have released shocking CCTV footage showing the moment a biker was mown down by a car in a targeted attack. The 20-year-old victim suffered two broken hips and other fractures in the horrific incident. The Manchester Evening News reports how a court has now heard that the innocent Suzuki rider who was hit was mistaken for someone else by his thug attackers. After knocking the biker over using a red Citroen in Burnage, Manchester, Louis Lomas, 22, and his 21-year-old passenger Callum Gervis approached the man on the ground. However, after realising he wasn’t the person they intended to hit, they dragged him on to the pavement and then ran from the scene. Both men have been jailed at Manchester Crown Court for the sickening attack. Lomas, of Burnage, has been sentenced to three years and four months for Grievous Bodily Harm (GBH)and has been disqualified from driving. Gervis of Moston, Manchester, has been sentenced to two years and four months for GBH and possession of Class B drugs. The attack took place just before 1am on January 7th this year. The victim was taken to hospital for treatment and later that evening, Lomas and Gervis were arrested. Detective Constable Steve Lowton, of Manchester Police, said: “Lomas and Gervis mowed this man down, and the footage we’ve released shows how brutal this assault really was. “I cannot imagine how this man must have felt to be thrown from his bike, before being run over and abandoned on the pavement.",

			"body": "Welsh politics is in the throes of an major changing of the guard.\n \n Andrew RT Davies is gone as leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Assembly. \n \nWe know that Carwyn Jones will have stood down as First Minister by the end of the year.\n \nUkip members will be balloted on who should lead its Assembly group.\n \nPlaid Cymru may also have a leadership contest of its own.\n \nThis could mean that every party represented in the Assembly – with the exception of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, whose leader is not an AM – will go into the 2021 elections with a new leader.\n \nEach of the parties faces vexing questions about its identity, its mission, and its strategy.\n \nThe changes also come at a time when the Assembly is braced for change. It has gained major new powers and there is the prospect of the number of AMs increasing.\n \nIt seems certain that, soon, none of the parties will be led by an AM who was there at the birth of the Assembly.\n \nThe Assembly has changed radically since Carwyn arrived \n \nFirst Minister Mr Jones was there on day one of the institution in 1999. He was present in the tumultuous first chapter when the future of the institution was far from assured.\n \nHe was in senior government positions as the Assembly gained law-making powers and passed landmark legislation. The Bridgend AM witnessed the construction of the Senedd and saw a body once derided as a talking shop evolve into a true legislature.\n \nYou could often sense a kinship between AMs of different parties who were part of that 1999 intake. It was as if they had been on the same ride down the rapids; until recently, one of the chief criticisms of the Assembly was it is just too cosy.\n \nBut the ambitious AMs who are now at the forefront of Welsh politics did not join an institution that looked in peril. They are in no doubt about the potential of the Assembly to shape the future of life in Wales and are ready to fight for control of the steering wheel and the accelerator.\n \nOne of the most common observations about how the Assembly has changed is that there is less of the palliness that defined early years. Party divisions are starker.\n \nWelsh politics is a battle for power \n \nIt should not be surprising that tribalism has increased. Politics in the Senedd is about a battle for power.\n \nThe Welsh Labour leadership contest is an opportunity for people to set out their vision for how the party’s values should be translated into policy. The rise of Jeremy Corbyn and the dominance of the left in the UK party means that old battles over the interpretation and application of socialism could be thrashed out once again.\n \nUntil the arrival of Mr Corbyn as UK leader, it was almost taken for granted that Welsh Labour would be to the left of party in Westminster. While Tony Blair championed partnerships with the private sector, many in Welsh Labour were proud of the “clear red water” which divided Wales and England when it came to policy priorities.\n \nWales was the land of free prescriptions; Westminster was where Labour introduced tuition fees.\n \nBut there is now the chance that Mr Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell will move into Downing St – and with that comes the possibility that Welsh Labour could find itself to the right of the UK party.\n \n \nFinance Secretary Mark Drakeford, only joined the Assembly in 2011 but is the favourite to succeed Mr Jones. The Cardiff West AM represents a link between two very different eras of modern Labour history.\n \nHe was an early supporter of Mr Corbyn but was also by the side of First Minister Rhodri Morgan as a key aide and has sat at Mr Jones’ cabinet table.\n \nHis challenge, if he wins, will be to design authentically left of centre policies which do not dent growth or frighten business and thus provide a model for the UK party to follow.\n \nHowever, the greatest change the next First Minister will face will come in March when the UK leaves the EU. European funding and participation in EU programmes shaped the first two decades of devolved government; the drama of Brexit will likely prove at least as influential on the next chapter of self-government in Wales.\n \nIt is uncertain whether the Conservatives will have a leadership contest. Preseli Pembrokeshire AM Paul Davies has been chosen as the group’s interim leader and been endorsed by Nick Ramsay, the Monmouth AM who was the runner-up in the 2011 contest.\n \n \nWhoever emerges at the helm, he or she will be a stark contrast with Andrew RT Davies, a high-decibel campaigner who championed Brexit. The arrival of someone with whom Plaid Cymru AMs enjoy better instinctive chemistry would trigger speculation about the potential for a power-sharing pact that could give Wales its first non-Labour First Minister.\n \nThis would be a spectacular changing of the guard – and one that came close to happening in 2011, when a coalition between the Tories, Plaid and the Lib Dems seemed within touching distance.\n \n The period in which nominations for a Plaid leadership challenge can be made will close next week. Activists have called for both Carmarthen East and Dinefwr’s Adam Price and Anglesey’s Rhun ap Iorwerth to mount a challenge. \n \n \nA contest would force the party to confront key questions. Is it willing to work with the Conservatives when that party is in power in Westminster?\n \nHow explicit a goal should independence become? Do changes in Labour mean Plaid should avoid trying to outflank it on the left?\n \nMeanwhile, Ukip is in a battle to secure a future for the party. The next leader of the group in the Assembly will not want to be the last person to hold that post.\n \nHe or she will have to ensure that by the time the next Assembly elections come round the party is known for more than splits and controversies. The next leader will have to scramble to win the trust of voters and convince them that Ukip can best defend their interests as the Brexit journey continues.\n \nBy 2021, the leader of every party will be able to agree on one thing: the Wales they are duty bound to serve has changed in ways nobody imagined in 1999.",

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Get daily updates pushed directly to you Subscribe to notifications A cross commemorating the life of John Roberts – who had 30 grandsons serving in the Great War – has been given the go-ahead. The oak memorial cross will be placed in Witheridge Churchyard almost a century after John died in the village, aged 90. John was born in Cruwys Morchard in 1829. He went to school, but never learned to read or write. By the age of 10, he was working full time as a farm boy, at Stickeridge Farm, just outside his home village. He married Mary Couch in Thelbridge in 1855 and they had 15 children, 12 sons and three daughters. When Mary died in 1900, John moved to Witheridge, to live with his son Thomas and his family at Newland Farm. John was 84 and had almost 100 grandchildren when the Great War broke out in 1914. He had more than 50 grandsons, at least 36 of whom were eligible to serve King and country. He lost seven of his grandsons in the war. Three were killed on the battlefields of the Western Front, three died from wounds sustained in action in France and Flanders and one died of heart disease in Mesopotamia. When he died just a few months after the war ended, he was a broken man. When his funeral took place on May 26, 1919, a special card produced for mourners, carrying the following verse, indicated the esteem in which he was held. Day after day we saw him fade, And quietly sink away; Yet often in our hearts we prayed That he might longer stay. He’s gone, the one we loved so well, To his eternal rest; He’s gone to Heaven we need not fear, To be forever blessed. He was buried in an unmarked grave in Witheridge Churchyard. His remarkable story disappeared into the shadows of history – until the publication in February this year of the book, History Maker , which tells the remarkable story of John and his 30 grandsons who went to war. John’s last resting place could not be traced because it was not issued with a grave number (the only way of identifying it on the local burial map). Consequently, the oak cross will make clear that he is buried within the churchyard. It is hoped that a small dedication ceremony can be performed when the cross is erected later this year. The verse on the funeral card published here has been kindly supplied by John and Margaret Chapman, of Norfolk. John is related to John Roberts’ youngest son, Sidney. The picture – from Witheridge Historical Archive – shows how John Roberts’ contribution to the war effort was reported 100 years ago.",
